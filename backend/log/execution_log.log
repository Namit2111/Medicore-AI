Updated on January 6, 2023Body temperatureAdultsChildrenBabiesDuring pregnancyHow to measureWhat to doWhen to see a doctorWhat affects temperature?Symptoms of a feverSummaryThe average adult body temperature is around 98.6°F (37°C), but individual baseline body temperatures can vary. Factors such as age and activity levels can affect a person’s normal body temperature.The way of measuring temperature may also affect the reading. In this article, we discuss typical temperature ranges for adults, children, and those who are pregnant. We also consider factors affecting body temperature and when to call a doctor.Body temperatureShare on PinterestAnna Efetova/Getty ImagesBody temperature readings vary depending on where a person takes the measurements on the body. For example, rectal temperature readings are higher than oral readings, while armpit readings tend to be lower.Body temperature readings can also vary depending on the following factors:a person’s agethe time of day, typically lowest in the early morning and highest in the late afternoona person’s recent activityfood and fluid intakeNormal temperature in adultsAccording to reviews, the average adult body temperature across all different reading sites is 97.86°F (36.59°C).Researchers also found that the average orally-taken adult body temperature falls between 97.2–98.6°F (36.24–37°C).Average body temperature can vary across demographics. A study of almost 35,500 people found that older adults had the lowest temperatures, and African American women had higher temperatures than white men.The researchers also found that certain medical conditions can affect body temperature. For example, people with an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) tended to have lower temperatures, while people with cancer had higher temperatures.Typically, the following temperatures suggest that someone has a fever:at least 100.4°F (38°C) is a feverabove 103.1°F (39.5°C) is a high feverabove 105.8°F (41°C) is a very high feverA fever may be a symptom of COVID-19.Coronavirus resourcesFor more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.Normal temperature in childrenThe average body temperature for children is around 97.52°F (36.4°C), but this can vary. As with adults, a temperature above 100.4°F (38°C) may indicate a fever in children.Normal temperature in babiesInfants tend to have higher body temperatures than older children and adults. The average body temperature for newborn babies is around 99.5°F (37.5°C).A baby’s temperature is higher because they have a larger body surface area relative to their body weight. Their bodies are also more metabolically active, which generates heat.Babies’ bodies do not regulate temperature as well as adults’ bodies. They sweat less when it is warm, meaning their bodies hold more heat. It may also be more difficult for them to cool down during a fever.Learn more about fever in babies here.Normal temperatures during pregnancyDuring pregnancy, a person’s basal metabolic rate (BMR) is higher. This means the body produces more heat.One study found that body temperature peaks at 96–99.5°F (35.6–37.5°C) around the 12th week of pregnancy. The average body temperature reaches its lowest point of around 95.5–99.1°F (35.3–37.3°C) just after the 33rd week.How to take your temperatureThere are many types of thermometers available.Digital thermometersDigital thermometers are readily available and can produce accurate temperature results. A person may use these at different parts of the body.Rectal measurement: Specialized digital rectal thermometers are a common option for taking the temperature of young children. A person should clean and lubricate the end of these devices before inserting them into the anus. The device will alert the user when it has made a reading and is safe to remove.Oral measurement: Standard digital thermometers are simple to use orally (by mouth). First, a person must make sure the tip of the device is clean. They will then place this under their tongue toward the back of their mouth and close their lips. The device will produce a reading on an integrated display.Axillary (armpit) measurement: A person can place a digital thermometer at their, or someone else’s, armpit. The arm must then remain tight to the body to ensure a good reading. This is a noninvasive option for taking a child’s temperature.Infrared thermometersInfrared thermometers can take temperature readings at a distance. However, these are not as accurate as other methods. People may use tympanic thermometers to take readings from the ear canal. To use, a person will: insert the device’s tip into their earalign it with their ear canalactivate the device until it produces a resultTemporal thermometers use an infrared signal to measure a person’s temperature. The user will typically hold the thermometer a few centimeters from a person’s forehead and wait for the device to produce a reading.One study concluded that while forehead and ear measurements are viable, nontraumatic screening options for infants, they are still not as accurate as rectal measurements.It is important for people to always follow the instructions on the thermometer package.What to do when body temperature is too low or too highIf a thermometer indicates a person’s body temperature is too high or too low, they may wish to take another reading to confirm the result.In all age ranges, a high temperature may result from short-term illnesses and usually does not cause significant harm in adults with otherwise good overall health.If a person has a high temperature, it is important they rest and drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. These at-home treatments also apply to children and babies.In hot climates, exercise or other physical activity may cause hyperthermia — an abnormally high body temperature. Unlike infection or fever, this is typically the result of outside factors. Moving to a cooler space and taking fluids will usually remedy hyperthermia.However, if a high temperature persists or increases, people should seek medical help.If a person’s temperature is below 95°F (35°C) they have hypothermia and should seek medical assistance.When to contact a doctorThe need for medical assistance can vary between age groups.AdultsIn many cases, a person with a fever will not require medical attention. However, if a person has a temperature of
or higher, they should contact their doctor.A person should also seek medical assistance if they experience any of the following alongside a fever:dehydrationlightheadednesssevere crampsa persistent, or worsening feverThe following people should also seek medical assistance if they experience fever:recent transplant participantspeople with compromised immune systemsthose on immunosuppressantsthose who have recently undergone cancer treatmentsIf a person’s temperature is over 106.7°F (41.5°C), they have hyperpyrexia, a very high fever. This can lead to permanent organ damage and death. Hyperpyrexia requires urgent medical assistance.If a person’s body temperature is too low, they may have hypothermia. This is a medical emergency, and they should seek assistance immediately. Doctors define hypothermia as a temperature dropping below 95°F (35°C).ChildrenA person should contact emergency services if a child has a temperature over 104°F (40°C). They should also seek medical help if a child has a high temperature that lasts for 5 days or more or is experiencing dehydration, vomiting, or diarrhea.If a child’s temperature drops below 95°F (35°C), medical assistance is essential.BabiesIf an infant 3 months or younger has a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or above, seek emergency medical attention. In young babies, a slight fever can signal a serious infection. In babies up to 6 months of age, a temperature of 102.2°F (39°C) or more is also reason to contact emergency services.As with adults and older children, if a baby’s temperature drops below 95°F (35°C), they will require immediate emergency assistance.What causes body temperature to change?An area of the brain called the hypothalamus regulates body temperature. If body temperature rises above or dips below the 98.6°F (37°C) mark, the hypothalamus works to regulate the temperature.If the body is too cold, the hypothalamus sends signals to make the body shiver, which warms the body. If the body is too hot, it sends messages to begin sweating, letting heat leave the body.Infections cause most fevers. A fever develops as the body’s natural way of reacting to and fighting infection.Symptoms of a feverDoctors consider a fever to be a body temperature that reaches or exceeds 100.4°F (38°C). Other symptoms include:appetite losschillsheadacheirritabilitymuscle achesshiveringsweatingweaknessSummaryThe ideal body temperature in adults is around 98.6°F (37°C), but this varies based on age, physical activity, and health. Body temperature also changes throughout the day. A temperature of above 100.4°F (38°C) signals a fever.Babies may have higher body temperatures than adults, but even a slight fever in babies can indicate a severe infection.Temperature readings from different body parts give a range of body temperatures that doctors consider normal. Rectal readings are higher than oral readings, and armpit readings tend to be lower.If a person has an unusually high or low temperature, they should seek medical attention immediately.Read this article in Spanish.Public HealthBiology / BiochemistryImmune System / VaccinesHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

UniversityReviewed/Revised Jul 2024VIEW PROFESSIONAL VERSIONGET THE QUICK FACTSCauses|Evaluation|Treatment|Essentials for Older People|Key Points|Fever is an elevated body temperature that occurs when the body's thermostat (located in the hypothalamus in the brain) resets at a higher temperature, primarily in response to an infection. Elevated body temperature that is not caused by a resetting of the temperature set point is called hyperthermia. Although 98.6° F (37° C) is considered normal temperature, body temperature varies throughout the day. It is lowest in the early morning and highest in the late afternoon—sometimes reaching 99.9° F (37.7° C). Similarly, a fever does not stay at a constant temperature. Sometimes temperature peaks every day and then returns to normal. This process is called intermittent fever. Alternatively, temperature varies but does not return to normal. This process is called remittent fever. Doctors no longer think that the pattern of the rise and fall of fever is very important in the diagnosis of certain disorders.Body temperature can be measured at several areas of the body. The most common sites are the mouth (oral temperature) and rectum (rectal temperature). Other sites include the ear, forehead, and, much less preferably, armpit. Temperature is typically measured using a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers containing mercury are not recommended because they can break and expose people to mercury.Oral temperatures are considered elevated whenThey are higher than 99° F (37° C) in the early morning.They are higher than 100.4° F (38° C) at any time after the early morning.They are higher than a person’s known normal everyday temperature.Rectal and ear temperatures are about 1.0° F (0.6° C) higher than oral temperatures. Skin temperatures (for example, the forehead) are about 1.0° F (0.6° C) lower than oral temperatures. Many people use the term “fever” loosely, often meaning that they feel too warm, too cold, or sweaty, but they have not actually measured their temperature.The ability to generate a fever is reduced in certain people (for example, those who are very old, very young, or who have an alcohol use disorder).(See also Overview of Infectious Disease and Fever in Infants and Children.)Consequences of feverThe symptoms people have are due mainly to the condition causing the fever rather than the fever itself.Although many people worry that fever can cause harm, the typical temporary elevations in body temperature ranging from 100.4° to 104° F (38° to 40° C) caused by most short-lived (acute) infections are well-tolerated by healthy adults. As one of the body's defenses against an infection, a fever can trigger the production of antibodies and make it more difficult for microorganisms to grow, and may lessen the severity of an infection and help it go away. However, a moderate fever may be slightly dangerous for adults with a heart or lung disorder because fever causes the heart rate and breathing rate to increase. Fever can also worsen mental status in people with dementia.Additionally, an extreme temperature elevation (typically more than 105.8° F, or 41° C) may be damaging. A body temperature this high can cause malfunction and ultimately failure of most organs. Such extreme elevation sometimes results from very severe infection (such as sepsis, malaria, or meningitis) but is more typically caused by heatstroke or use of certain illicit drugs (such as
or PCP).Fever in healthy children can cause febrile seizures.Causes of Fever in AdultsSubstances that cause fever are called pyrogens. Pyrogens can come from inside or outside the body. Microorganisms and the substances they produce (such as toxins) are examples of pyrogens formed outside the body. Pyrogens formed inside the body are usually produced by 2 types of white blood cells called monocytes and macrophages. Pyrogens from outside the body can cause fever by stimulating the body to release its own pyrogens or by directly affecting the area of the brain that controls temperature.Many disorders can cause fever. They are broadly categorized asInfectious (most common)Neoplastic (cancer)Inflammatory (including autoimmune disorders, allergic reactions, and some drug reactions)An infectious cause is highly likely in adults with a fever that lasts 4 days or less (called an acute fever). An acute fever in people with cancer or a known inflammatory disorder also is most likely to have an infectious cause. In healthy people, an acute fever is unlikely to be the first sign of a chronic illness. A noninfectious cause is more likely to cause fever that lasts a long time or returns. Infectious causesInfections are the most common causes of fever. Infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Virtually all infections can cause fever, but, overall, the most likely infectious causes are the following:Upper and lower respiratory tract infectionsGastrointestinal infectionsUrinary tract infections (UTIs)Skin infectionsMost acute respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections are viral.Neoplastic causesMany cancers cause fever, for example, leukemia, lymphoma, and kidney cancer. Inflammatory causesInflammatory disorders that cause fever include systemic rheumatic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), and giant cell arteritis. Fever may also result from an allergic reaction.Medications and drugs sometimes cause fever. For example, beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin) and sulfa medications can trigger a fever. Certain illicit drugs (such as , amphetamines, or phencyclidine) and medications such as anesthetics and antipsychotics can cause an extremely high temperature.Risk factorsCertain factors help doctors determine what is the most likely cause of fever in a person. These factors include the following:The person's health status, age, and occupationHospitalizationUse of certain medications or illicit drugsExposure to infections (for example, through travel or contact with infected people, animals, or insects)Table Some Causes of Fever Based on Risk FactorsRisk FactorCauseNone (healthy)Upper or lower respiratory tract infectionGastrointestinal infectionUrinary tract infectionSkin infectionHospitalizationBloodstream infection related to a catheter inserted in a vein (IV catheter infection)Urinary tract infection, particularly in people with a urinary catheterPneumonia, particularly in people on a ventilatorAtelectasis (collapse of part of a lung due to an airway blockage, rather than an infection)Infection or a pocket of blood (hematoma) at the site of surgeryDeep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolismDiarrhea (due to Clostridioides difficile–induced colitis)MedicationsTransfusion reactionPressure soresTravel to areas where an infection is common (endemic areas)MalariaViral hepatitisDisorders that cause diarrheaTyphoid feverZika virus, chikungunya, Ebola virus, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, measles, and yellow feverDengue feverFungal infections such as coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, or histoplasmosisRickettsial infections (such as African tick-bite fever and Mediterranean spotted fever)Exposure to insects or animals that carry disease-causing organisms, called vectors (in the United States)Ticks: Rickettsiosis, ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, babesiosis, relapsing fever, or tularemiaMosquitoes: Encephalitis caused by arboviruses, malaria, or Zika virus infection; yellow feverWild animals: Tularemia, rabies, or hantavirus infectionFleas: PlagueDomestic animals: Brucellosis, cat-scratch disease, Q fever, or toxoplasmosisBirds: Psittacosis, bird fluReptiles: Salmonella infectionBats: Rabies or histoplasmosisA weakened immune system (immunocompromise)Viruses: Varicella-zoster virus infection or cytomegalovirus infectionBacteria: Infection due to pneumococci, meningococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Nocardia, or mycobacteriaFungi: Infection due to Candida, Aspergillus, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, microsporidia, Pneumocystis jirovecii, or fungi that cause mucormycosisParasites: Infection due to Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Cryptosporidium, or Cystoisospora belliMedications and illicit drugs that can alter body temperatureAmphetaminesPhencyclidine (PCP)Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or Ecstasy)Antipsychotic medications (can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome)Anesthetics (inhaled anesthetic gases such as halothane can cause malignant hyperthermia)ThyroxineInterferons (medications that are based on substances produced by the immune system and that help block the reproduction of viruses)Medications that can trigger fever by a hypersensitivity (allergic) reactionBeta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin)Sulfa drugsPhenytoinCarbamazepineProcainamideQuinidineEvaluation of Fever in AdultsUsually, a doctor can determine that an infection is present based on a brief history, a physical examination, and occasionally a few simple tests, such as a chest x-ray and urine tests. However, sometimes the cause of fever is not readily identified.When doctors initially evaluate people with an acute fever, they focus on 2 general issues:Identifying other symptoms such as headache or cough: These symptoms help narrow the range of possible causes.Determining whether the person is seriously or chronically ill: Many of the possible acute viral infections go away on their own and also are difficult for doctors to diagnose specifically (that is, to determine exactly which virus is causing the infection). Limiting testing to people who are seriously or chronically ill can help avoid many expensive, unnecessary, and often fruitless searches.Warning signsIn people with an acute fever, certain signs and characteristics are cause for concern. They includeA change in mental function, such as confusionA headache, stiff neck, or bothFlat, small, purplish red spots on the skin (petechiae), which indicate bleeding under the skinLow blood pressureRapid heart rate or rapid breathingShortness of breath (dyspnea)A temperature that is higher than 104° F (40° C) or lower than 95° F (35° C)Recent travel to an area where a serious infectious disease such as malaria is commonRecent use of medications that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants)When to see a doctorPeople who have any warning signs should see a doctor right away. Such people typically need immediate testing and often admission to a hospital.People without warning signs should call the doctor if the fever lasts more than 24 to 48 hours. Depending on the person's age, other symptoms, and known medical conditions, the doctor may ask the person to come for evaluation or recommend treatment at home. Typically, people should see a doctor if a fever lasts more than 3 or 4 days regardless of other symptoms.What the doctor doesDoctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history. Doctors then do a physical examination. What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the fever and the tests that may need to be done.A doctor begins by asking a person about present and previous symptoms and disorders, medications currently being taken, any blood transfusions, exposure to infections, recent travel, vaccinations, and recent hospitalizations, surgeries, or other medical procedures. The pattern of the fever rarely helps the doctor make a diagnosis. However, a fever that returns every other day or every third day is typical of malaria. Doctors consider malaria and other insect-transmitted infections as a possible cause only if people have traveled to an area where the infection is common.Recent travel may give the doctor clues as to the cause of a fever because some infections occur in certain areas. For example, coccidioidomycosis (a fungal infection) occurs mostly in the southwestern United States.Recent exposures are also important. For example, people who work in a meatpacking plant are more likely to develop brucellosis (a bacterial infection spread through contact with domestic animals). Other examples include unsafe water or food (such as unpasteurized milk and milk products, and raw or undercooked meat, fish, and shellfish), insect (such as mosquitoes) and tick bites, unprotected sex, and occupational or recreational exposures (such as hunting, hiking, and water sports).Pain is an important clue to the possible source of fever, so the doctor asks about any pain in the ears, head, neck, teeth, throat, chest, abdomen, flank, rectum, muscles, and joints.Other symptoms that help determine the cause of the fever include nasal congestion and/or discharge, cough, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency, and pain while urinating). Knowing whether the person has enlarged lymph nodes or a rash (including what it looks like, where it is, and when it appeared in relation to other symptoms) may help the doctor pinpoint a cause. People with recurring fevers, night sweats, and weight loss may have a chronic infection such as tuberculosis or endocarditis (infection of the heart's lining and usually the heart valves).The doctor may also ask about the following:Contact with anyone who has an infectionAny known conditions that predispose to infection, such as HIV infection, diabetes, cancer, organ transplantation, sickle cell disease, use of an artificial pacemaker, or heart valve disorders, particularly if an artificial valve is presentAny known disorders that may cause a fever without infection, such as lupus, gout, sarcoidosis, an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), or cancerUse of any medications that may make a person susceptible to infection, such as cancer chemotherapy, corticosteroids, or other medications that suppress the immune systemUse of illicit drugs that are injectedThe physical examination begins with confirmation of fever. Fever is most accurately determined by measuring rectal temperature, but oral or ear temperature is often measured. Forehead temperature is not as accurate as rectal, but doctors may measure forehead temperature to screen people for fever. Armpit temperature is the least accurate, so doctors rarely use it to confirm a fever. Doctors then do a thorough examination from head to toe to check for a source of infection or evidence of disease.TestingThe need for testing depends on what the doctor finds during the medical history and physical examination.Otherwise healthy people who have an acute fever and only vague, general symptoms (for example, they feel generally ill or achy) probably have a viral illness that will go away without treatment. Therefore, they do not usually require testing. Exceptions are people who are in an area where COVID-19 is being spread, people who have been exposed to an animal or insect that carries and transmits a specific disease (called a vector), such as people with a tick bite, and people who have recently been in an area where a particular disorder (such as malaria) is common.If otherwise healthy people have findings that suggest a particular disorder, testing may be needed. Doctors select tests based on those findings. For example, if people have a headache and stiff neck, a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) is done to look for meningitis. If people have a cough and lung congestion, a chest x-ray is done to look for pneumonia. For certain respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19 or influenza, there are rapid molecular tests that can give results within minutes or a few hours. Some rapid tests can be done at home or in a doctor's office on a sample obtained with a cotton swab. Other rapid tests to identify a specific cause of an infection require a blood sample sent to a laboratory.People who are at increased risk of infection, people who appear seriously ill, and older adults often need testing even when findings do not suggest a particular disorder. For such people, doctors may do the following:A complete blood count (including the number and proportion of different types of white blood cells)Urine and blood culturesA chest x-rayUrinalysisLab TestComplete Blood CountLab TestUrinalysisAn increase in the white blood cell count usually indicates infection. The proportion of different types of white blood cells (differential count) gives further clues. For example, an increase in neutrophils suggests a relatively new bacterial infection. An increase in eosinophils suggests the presence of parasites, such as tapeworms or roundworms. Also, blood, urine, and other body fluids may be sent to the laboratory to try to grow the microorganism in a culture. Other blood tests can be used to detect antibodies against specific microorganisms.Fever of unknown origin (FUO)A fever of unknown origin may be diagnosed when People have a fever of at least 101° F (38.3° C) for several weeks.Extensive investigation does not detect a cause.In such cases, the cause may be an unusual chronic infection (such as tuberculosis, bacterial infection of the heart, HIV infection, cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus) or something other than an infection, such as a systemic rheumatic disorder (such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis) or cancer (such as lymphoma, ovarian cancer, or leukemia). Other causes include medication or illicit drug reactions, blood clots (deep vein thrombosis), inflammation of organ tissues (sarcoidosis), and inflammatory bowel disease.In older adults, the most common causes of FUO are giant cell arteritis, lymphomas, abscesses, and tuberculosis.Doctors usually do blood tests, including a complete blood count, blood cultures, liver blood tests, and tests to check for systemic rheumatic disorders. Other tests, such as chest x-ray, urinalysis, and urine culture, may be done.Lab TestBacteria Culture TestUltrasound studies, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly of areas that are causing discomfort, may help a doctor diagnose the cause. Radionuclide scanning, done after white blood cells labeled with a radioactive marker are injected into a vein, or positron emission tomography (PET) may be used to identify areas of infection or inflammation.If these test results are negative, doctors may need to take a sample of tissue from the liver, bone marrow, or another site of suspected infection for biopsy. The sample is then examined under a microscope, cultured, and analyzed.The treatment of FUO is focused on treating the disorder causing the fever if it is known. Doctors may give medications to lower the body temperature (see treatment of fever).Treatment of Fever in AdultsThe best fever treatment is treatment of the cause.Because fever helps the body defend against infection and because fever itself is not dangerous (unless it is higher than about 106° F [41° C]), there is some debate as to whether fever should be routinely treated. However, people with a high fever generally feel much better when the fever is treated. Plus, people with a heart or lung disorder and those with dementia are considered to be at particular risk of dangerous complications, so when they have a fever, it should be treated.Medications used to lower body temperature are called antipyretics.Because many over-the-counter cold or flu preparations contain acetaminophen, people must be careful not to take acetaminophen and one or more of these cold or flu preparations at the same time.Other cooling measures (such as cooling with a tepid water mist and using cooling blankets) are needed only if the temperature is about 106° F (41.1° C) or higher. People should not apply rubbing alcohol to their skin with a washcloth or sponge because alcohol can be absorbed through the skin and may have harmful effects.People who have a blood infection (bacteremia) or who have abnormal vital signs (such as low blood pressure and a rapid pulse and breathing rate) are admitted to the hospital.Essentials for Older People: FeverFever can be tricky in older people because the body may not respond the way it would in younger people. For example, in frail older adults, infection is less likely to cause fever. Even when elevated by infection, the temperature may be lower than the standard definition of fever, and the degree of fever may not correspond to the severity of the illness. Similarly, other symptoms, such as pain, may be less noticeable. Frequently, a change in mental function or a decline in daily functioning is the only other initial sign of pneumonia or a urinary tract infection.However, older adults with a fever are more likely to have a serious bacterial infection than are younger adults with a fever. As in younger adults, the cause is commonly a respiratory or urinary tract infection. Skin and soft-tissue infections are also common causes of fever in older adults. Older adults are more likely to have serious manifestations of respiratory viral infections such as influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Diagnosis of fever in older adults is similar to that for younger adults, except that for older adults, doctors usually recommend urine tests (including culture) and a chest x-ray. Samples of blood are cultured to rule out a blood infection (bacteremia).Key PointsMost fevers in healthy people are caused by a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection due to a virus.If people with a fever have any warning signs, they should see a doctor right away.Doctors can usually identify an infection based on a brief medical history, a physical examination, and occasionally a few simple tests, and then doctors use these results, particularly symptoms, to determine which other tests are needed.Doctors consider underlying chronic disorders, particularly those that impair the immune system, as a possible cause of fever that lasts a long time.In older adults, infections are less likely to cause fever, and other symptoms may be less noticeable.Test your KnowledgeTake a Quiz!

Updated on October 4, 2018Squeezing sensationNausea, sensitivity to light, soundWaking upFever or stiff neckRapid, severe painHead injuryVision problemsUnusual headachesTriggersTakeaway OverviewHeadaches are extremely common. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly half of adults the world over will have a headache at some point this year.Headaches usually go away without causing further problems. Even many chronic headaches, such as migraines and cluster headaches, aren’t considered signs of more severe, underlying problems. They may need to be treated to improve your life, but they won’t put your life at risk.Nevertheless, if you experience any unusual symptoms, make immediate arrangements to visit a doctor or the emergency room (ER). Headache that feels like head squeezingThe tension-type headache is the most common primary headache. It’s usually bilateral, which means that it affects both sides of the head. It’s commonly described as a squeezing sensation.Tension-type headaches can be stress- or musculoskeletal-related. They can be treated with over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and aspirin (Bayer). Headache accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light and soundThese are common symptoms of migraine headaches. Migraines cause a throbbing sensation that usually occurs on just one side of the head.They’re one of the top 10 causes of disability worldwide. They aren’t life-threatening, but they can severely impact your well-being.If you’re experiencing migraines, it’s important for you to find out if there’s a cause. Migraines are most common in people 30 to 40 years old, according to The Migraine Trust. According to the Office on Women’s Health, around 75 percent of people affected by migraines are women.Factors that can make a person more likely to experience chronic migraines include:obesitydiabetesdepressionhypertensionstressful life eventsA variety of prescription drugs are available to treat migraines. Other treatments include OTC painkillers such as Excedrin Migraine and alternative methods such as acupuncture and herbal remedies. Headache that wakes you upBeing woken by head pain is a common symptom of cluster headaches. These are also known as alarm clock headaches. Like migraines, cluster headaches occur most often on just one side of the head.Cluster headaches happen in patterns called cluster periods, during which time the pain can be quite intense and prevent you from sleeping. Sometimes cluster headache pain is centered around one or both of the eyes.Cluster headaches are generally not life-threatening. However, they can be debilitating, so you’ll want to find out the underlying cause.Headaches that wake you from your sleep can also be caused by medical conditions such as high blood pressure, sleep apnea, and brain tumors. Depression and caffeine withdrawal can also cause cluster headaches.Cluster headaches are most likely to affect people between 20 to 50 years old and men, according to the Mayo Clinic.Home remedies that may bring relief include magnesium supplements, melatonin, and capsaicin cream. Other treatment methods include supplemental oxygen, triptan medications, and the intravenous medication dihydroergotamine (DHE). Headache with a fever or stiff neckA headache combined with a fever or a stiff neck may indicate encephalitis or meningitis. Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain, while meningitis is inflammation of the membrane that surrounds the brain.When due to severe infection, either condition can be fatal. A compromised immune system, diabetes mellitus, and use of immune-system suppressing medication can make you more susceptible to these infections.These infections must be treated immediately with intravenous antibiotic therapy. Thunderclap headacheA thunderclap headache is an extremely severe headache that comes on rapidly. It’s sometimes called a lone acute headache. It develops in 60 seconds or less and causes intense pain.Thunderclap headaches can be caused by bleeding in the brain after an arterial aneurysm rupture, stroke, or other injury.Pain from thunderclap headaches might occur anywhere on your head and extend to your neck or even areas of your lower back. The intense pain can last for an hour or more, and might be accompanied by dizziness, nausea, or loss of consciousness.Meningitis, encephalitis, and brain tumors can cause thunderclap headaches. Hypertension is a more common cause.The treatment for this kind of headache will depend on the cause. It’s important to speak to a doctor immediately if you have a headache that reaches peak intensity in a minute or less and doesn’t subside. Headache after a head injuryAny head trauma that causes a headache requires prompt medical attention. A headache after any kind of impact to the head can indicate a concussion.Concussion is a particular risk if the headache continues to worsen after the injury. Even a minor fall or bump to the head can result in potentially life-threatening bleeding in the brain. Headache accompanied by vision problemsAn ocular migraine can temporarily cause blindness or flashing lights in one eye. These symptoms will sometimes accompany a typical migraine headache as well.If your migraines or regular headaches are accompanied by these visual disturbances, you need to tell your doctor. It’s possible that spasms in the retina cause these symptoms. People who experience ocular migraines may be more prone to long-term vision loss.Migraines with auras, formerly known as classic migraines, can also cause “floating” lights or blind spots. In that case, however, the symptoms will occur in both eyes. New or unusual headachesBesides the specific headache symptoms described above, any new or unusual headaches should be discussed with your doctor. Pay particular attention to headaches that:first develop after age 50suddenly change in frequency, location, or severityget consistently worse over timeare accompanied by changes in personalitycause weaknessaffect your vision or speechWomen who are experiencing menopause might find that they have new headache patterns or experience migraines when they never have before.COPING WITH HEADACHESHeadaches are very common, but certain characteristics can signal a serious condition. For more common headaches, such as tension, cluster, or even migraine headaches, there are triggers, which can vary from person to person. Paying attention to your triggers and making small adjustments to your lifestyle may help avoid headache attacks. — Seunggu Han, MD Headache triggersSometimes a headache can indicate that your body is experiencing withdrawal from a chemical substance (such as caffeine). Other times your headache might be triggered by the dehydrating effects of alcohol consumption.It’s also not unusual for people to experience headaches when they quit smoking tobacco products, due to nicotine withdrawal. These headache triggers are usually not indicative of any greater medical problem, and lifestyle choices can ensure that these headaches won’t continue.Fatigue headaches, sometimes called exertional headaches, can be caused when your body is strained by too much physical activity. Eye muscle strain and lack of sleep can cause a dull throbbing headache that feels similar to an exertional headache.Making sure to get enough rest, taking frequent breaks from computer work, and drinking the recommended amount of water each day will probably stop these headaches from happening.KEEP A JOURNALKeeping a journal with details of what you were doing or what was happening at the time of your headaches may help to pinpoint things that you may want to avoid in the future to prevent a similar headache from recurring. — Stacy R. Sampson, DO TakeawayTreatments for headaches will vary widely, depending on their cause. Most headaches can be treated at home with ibuprofen or aspirin to relieve mild pain.But if you’re experiencing any of the warning signs listed above, you’ll need to seek a doctor’s counsel for how to best treat your symptoms.Antidepressant medication, blood pressure medication, lifestyle changes, and other treatment regimens may be recommended to aid you in getting headache relief.How we reviewed this article:SourcesHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

When to Seek Care
The combination of a fever and a headache is a common sign of infection. Some infections that cause fever and headache, such as bacterial meningitis, can be serious and require hospitalization. Other infections that cause fever and headache are more run-of-the-mill and will get better on their own. Sometimes, fever and headache can be a sign of a chronic, non-infectious illness, like lupus or heatstroke.
The article discusses both infectious and non-infectious causes of a headache with a fever. It also covers other possible symptoms and when you should see a healthcare provider.
Verywell / Joshua Seong
Meningitis
Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the protective membranes around the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis is usually caused by viruses or bacteria, but it can also be caused by some medicines or non-infectious illnesses.
While any type of meningitis can be serious, viral meningitis tends to be less severe than bacterial meningitis.
Symptoms
In addition to a severe, generalized headache and a high fever, symptoms of meningitis may include:
Neck stiffnessNauseaVomitingConfusionRashSensitivity to lightJoint painsSeizures
A person who has meningitis typically will not have all of these symptoms. If you think you may have symptoms of meningitis, seek immediate medical care.
In the majority of people with meningitis, nuchal rigidity will be present. This means that a person can’t easily flex their neck, and they may be unable to touch their chin to their chest.
Treatment
With viral meningitis, there is no specific treatment. Most people recover on their own from viral meningitis after a week to 10 days. An antiviral medication could help if the meningitis is caused by certain viruses such as influenza or herpes virus.
Bacterial meningitis is treated with antibiotics. Because bacterial meningitis can be a serious, life-threatening infection, it’s important to start treatment as soon as possible.
Encephalitis
Encephalitis is an infection of the central nervous system that may be caused by a virus, bacteria, or fungus.
The key difference between meningitis and encephalitis is that meningitis is inflammation of the lining around the brain and encephalitis is inflammation of the brain itself. Both meningitis and encephalitis can cause abnormalities in brain function leading to confusion and seizures.
Encephalitis is a serious, life-threatening disease that needs immediate medical attention. Severe cases lead to death in about 10% of patients.
Because the two can be so difficult to differentiate, doctors sometimes use the term “meningoencephalitis.”
Symptoms
In addition to fever and headache, symptoms of encephalitis include:
Joint painMuscle weaknessStiff neckNausea
Encephalitis causes symptoms with brain function as well, including:
ConfusionBehavior changesSensitivity to lightDifficulty speakingTrouble movingMemory issuesLoss of consciousnessSeizures
Treatment
Treatment depends on the type of encephalitis you have. If it’s a bacterial infection, antibiotics should be prescribed. For viral infections, antiviral medications may be given.Other treatments may depend on the severity and effects of the illness. Steroids may be given to reduce swelling and brain pressure.
Cold or Flu
Influenza, commonly known as “the flu,” mononucleosis "mono," and the common cold can cause fever and headache. These illnesses are caused by viruses that spread easily from person to person.
Mono is usually mild, and the flu can cause mild symptoms or severe illness. In some instances, it can be serious enough to be life-threatening, especially for those over 65, people with chronic illnesses, and newborns.
Symptoms
Along with fever and headache, other symptoms of the flu or mono may include:
Chills
Cough
Stuffy or runny nose
Muscle aches
Fatigue (tiredness)
Vomiting or diarrhea are possible (more common in children)
When you have a cold, the symptoms can be similar to the flu. Fever and headache are possible but less common with a cold than with the flu.
Symptoms of a cold include:
SneezingRunny or stuffy noseSore throatCough
Treatment
Often, the best treatment for a cold, the flu, or mono is to stay home, get lots of rest, and drink lots of fluids. Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen may also help with a headache and fever.
If you have the flu, your doctor may be able to prescribe antiviral drugs. These can reduce the amount of time you’re sick by a couple of days and decrease the chance of complications.
Physicians don’t prescribe antibiotics for a cold, the flu, or mono since they’re not effective against viruses. However, if you get a complication from the cold or flu, such as a bacterial sinus infection, you might need an antibiotic.
Brain Abscess
A brain abscess is a rare, but potentially life-threatening condition, in which infected fluid collects in the brain.
A headache from a brain abscess occurs as a result of elevated intracranial pressure as the abscess continues to grow and take up space.
Symptoms
Symptoms of a brain abscess can resemble that of meningitis or encephalitis. In addition to fever and headache, symptoms include:
Neck stiffnessChillsVomitingConfusion, trouble focusing, or sleepinessWeaknessLanguage problemsLoss of muscle function, usually on one sideVision changesSeizures
Treatment
Medication may be the first step if the abscess is less than 2 centimeters or the abscess is deep in the brain. This can include antibiotics or antifungal medication, depending on what caused the infection. Diuretics, which reduce fluid, may also be used to decrease swelling in the brain.
Surgery may be needed to drain the abscess if it’s larger than 2 centimeters or if it might rupture. If the abscess is deep, needle aspiration guided by a CT or MRI scan may be used to drain the fluid.
Sinus Infection
A sinus infection, or sinusitis, is the swelling or inflammation of the lining in your sinuses. Your sinuses are hollow spaces behind your forehead, eyes, and cheeks that connect to your nasal passages.
The sinuses make thin mucus that drains out of the nose. When they become blocked with fluid, bacteria can grow and cause an infection. This extra mucus could be caused by a cold or allergies.
Symptoms
A bacterial sinus infection can give you a fever and a sinus headache, which you may feel around your eyes and forehead.
Other symptoms include:
Facial tenderness or swellingEar painTooth painThick nasal discharge
Treatment
If you have bacterial sinusitis, a week or so of antibiotics, rest, fluids, and steam should clear it up quickly. Very rarely sinus infections lead to other complications like a brain abscess, meningitis, blood clot, or osteomyelitis—an infection of the facial bones (especially the forehead).
If you are diagnosed with a sinus infection, be sure to follow up with your healthcare provider if your fever persists while taking antibiotics.
Heatstroke
Heatstroke is the most severe form of heat-related illness. It happens when your body overheats to over 106°F and you aren’t able to sweat enough to cool your body down. It can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention.
Symptoms
The symptoms of heatstroke include:
High body temperature (over 106°F)Confusion or altered mental statusLoss of consciousness (coma)Slurred speechHot, dry skin or excessive sweatingSeizuresDeath, unless treated promptly
Treatment
Heatstroke is a medical emergency. Call 911 if you suspect heatstroke.
While waiting for medical help, try cooling the person’s body as quickly as possible. Get to a shady, cool area. Have them lie down and elevate their feet. Apply cold water to the skin and then use a fan to help cool the body quickly.
In the emergency room, intravenous (IV) fluids will be used to replace fluids lost.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) causes pain, stiffness, and swelling in the joints. It’s an autoimmune disease, which means that it happens when the immune system attacks the body’s own healthy tissues. In some cases, it can cause fever and headaches.
Symptoms
RA can occasionally cause mild fevers. It can also cause headaches, particularly if it affects the cervical spine.
Other symptoms include:
Neck or back painSwelling of jointsWarmth around jointsWeaknessFatigue
Treatment
Treatment for RA typically includes disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These can slow the progression of RA by modifying your immune system. Biologic agents are sometimes used to control inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.
HIV or AIDS
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) damages your immune system by attacking a type of white blood cell that fights infections.
If HIV isn’t treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection in which the immune system is severely damaged.
Early HIV or AIDS can cause many different symptoms. Headache and fever are possible symptoms of both.
Symptoms
Symptoms of early HIV infection can happen two to four weeks after exposure to the virus. These early symptoms are estimated to affect about two-thirds of those infected.
Early HIV symptoms include:
Fever (above 100.4 degrees F)HeadacheSore throatMuscle and joint painRash that occurs two to three days after fever
If HIV isn’t treated, it weakens your immune system and can lead to AIDS. At this stage, you’re more likely to develop “opportunistic infections,” severe illnesses that your body can’t fight off. Depending on the infection, symptoms can include fevers, shortness of breath, blurred vision, and weight loss.
Treatment
While there isn’t a cure for HIV, medications are available to control it. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) involves taking a daily combination of HIV medications. This reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and helps protect the immune system.
Lupus
Lupus is an autoimmune disease. It can cause swelling and pain throughout your body. Your symptoms can be minimal at times and flare up at other times, suddenly becoming more severe.
Symptoms
Headaches are a common symptom for people with lupus. In a 2021 study, 54% of patients with lupus reported having primary headaches, with migraines being the most common.
Reoccuring low-grade fevers are also common before a lupus flare or oncoming illness.
Other symptoms include:
Joint stiffness, pain, or swellingFatigueSwelling in the hands or feetSensitivity to lightChest pain when taking deep breathsHair lossSores in the mouth or noseButterfly-shaped rash on cheeks and nose
Treatment
There is no cure for lupus, but different types of medications are available to treat symptoms and manage the illness. Some medications can help treat swelling and pain. Others help prevent the immune system from attacking tissues in the body.
For mild pain and fevers, your physician may suggest over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen.
Corticosteroids such as prednisone can help reduce pain and calm the immune system. They may be prescribed in either low or high doses, depending on the severity of the illness.
Antimalarial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate may also be prescribed. In addition to treating malaria, they help treat joint pain, fatigue, and lung inflammation with lupus.
Other Causes
There are also less common causes of the combination of fever and headache. Some of them are rare, and some may cause a headache or fever, but do not usually cause that combination.
Your healthcare provider might consider these causes if your symptoms are unusual or if the initial testing and treatments for more common causes don't provide answers or relief.
Conditions may include:
Giant cell arteritis: Also called temporal arteritis, this is an inflammatory condition of the arteries that run under the scalp. It can cause pain, vision changes, and a fever.
Sarcoidosis: This inflammatory condition is not common. Neurosarcoidosis can cause inflammation in or near the brain, potentially causing neurological symptoms, and it may cause a headache. A fever is not a common sign of sarcoidosis.
Pituitary apoplexy: This is a rare condition that occurs when the blood supply to the pituitary gland is blocked or when there is bleeding of this gland. It can cause a headache, nausea, vomiting, vision changes, fever, and loss of consciousness.
Brain tumor: A primary brain tumor that starts in the brain or a metastatic brain tumor that spreads to the brain from somewhere else In the body can cause a headache and neurological symptoms (such as vision changes or weakness). This doesn't usually cause a fever.
Osteomyelitis: Inflammation or an infection of bone may affect the skull or upper spine, causing a headache with a fever. This is not a common condition.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage: A blood vessel rupture can cause a severe headache, often with changes in consciousness. A fever is not a typical symptom of this life-threatening condition.
When to See a Healthcare Provider
If you have a fever and headache, you may need to get medical care to determine the cause. Call your doctor to let them know your symptoms.
Go to the doctor right away if you experience any of the following:
A severe headacheA headache that doesn’t go away with medicationFever and/or headache that are persistentHeadache and fever that get worse instead of improvingHeadaches and fever that happen more often than usual
Seek immediate medical care if you have fever and headache in addition to these symptoms:
Stiff or painful neckRashVomitingConfusionFaintingChanges in consciousnessVision changesLoss of muscle functionDifficulty speaking or movingSeizures
You should also go to the emergency room for extremely painful headaches that occur suddenly. These are called thunderclap headaches because they can appear suddenly like a crash of thunder.
Some thunderclap headaches can occur because of a problem with blood vessels in the brain. This can include a stroke or a brain aneurysm.
A thunderclap headache can represent a serious, life-threatening medical condition, so get help right away by either calling 911 or going to your nearest emergency room.
Summary
Having both a fever and headache can be signs of an infectious or non-infectious condition. Some illnesses may be mild, such as the common cold. Others can be serious, or even life-threatening, such as meningitis or a brain abscess.
Call your doctor if you have any questions about what could be causing your headache and fever. Let them know if you have new or concerning symptoms, or if they’re persistent or getting worse. Seek emergency care for any severe symptoms.

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm — or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs) — also known as your body's "thermostat" — monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis — inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children.

A low grade fever is when the body temperature rises slightly, usually between about 100.5°F and 102.2°F.The fever is persistent when the body temperature stays in this range for more than 2 weeks.A fever is commonly a result of the body trying to fight off an infection or another illness. However, some cases are more difficult to diagnose and treat.Continue reading to learn more about the symptoms, causes, and treatment of a persistent low grade fever.SymptomsShare on PinterestIf the body is fighting off an infection, a person may experience a persistent low grade fever.Some people may hardly notice that they have a low grade fever. However, others may experience various symptoms, including:feeling warm to the touchsweatingchillsshiveringheadachesmuscle achesdehydrationa general feeling of being unwellCausesA persistent low grade fever is typically a sign that the body is fighting off an infection or another health issue and has raised its temperature to help these efforts.These underlying issues can include:Respiratory infectionsRespiratory infections can cause a persistent low grade fever. Some of the most common respiratory infections, such as a cold or the flu, may cause a low grade fever that lasts for as long as the body takes to fight off the infection.Other symptoms that may indicate a respiratory infection include:coughingsneezinga stuffy or runny nosea sore throatchillsgeneral fatiguelack of appetiteMany simple respiratory infections do not require treatment, and the symptoms will go away in time.Urinary tract infectionsA urinary tract infection (UTI) may also be the underlying cause of a low grade fever. A UTI is a bacterial infection that occurs when bacteria multiply anywhere in the urinary tract, which includes the bladder, urethra, kidneys, and ureters.In addition to a low grade fever, the person may experience symptoms such as:pain in the abdomena burning sensation while peeingfrequent urinationa constant urge to urinatedark urineMost UTIs are simple to treat with antibiotics. The doctor may analyze a urine sample to determine the precise type of bacteria causing the infection to ensure that they prescribe the right treatment.Other infectionsShare on PinterestA person should talk to their doctor if they experience any symptoms of infection alongside a fever.Almost any infection can cause a fever. A fever is one of the body’s natural responses to foreign invaders. The body may keep its core temperature elevated while it is fighting off the infection.Other sources of infections that may cause a low grade fever include:food poisoningexposure to pathogens from livestocktuberculosismeningitisAnyone experiencing symptoms of infection alongside a fever should see a doctor if the symptoms do not improve with rest and time.MedicationsSome medications can cause many different side effects, which may include a low grade fever. People can check the information on side effects and interactions that comes in the packaging or seek advice from a pharmacist.As the author of a 2018 review notes, if the medication is the cause, the fever should go away very quickly — typically within 72 hours — once the person stops taking the drug.StressChronic stress may cause a low grade fever. A research paper from 2015 notes that a fever due to stress is most common in young women.Reducing stress levels may resolve the fever in these cases.CancerIn rare cases, a persistent low grade fever with no known cause may be a sign of cancer.A persistent fever can be a symptom of leukemia, Hodgkin disease, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.The person may also experience other symptoms of cancer, including:persistent fatigueweaknessheadachesinfectionslack of appetiteexcessive bruising or bleedingunexplained weight lossenlarged lymph nodesexcessive sweating at nightMany of these symptoms are not unique to cancer, however.Anyone who experiences these symptoms along with a low grade fever should see a doctor for a diagnosis.Chronic disordersMany other chronic disorders may cause symptoms such as a low grade fever, including:thromboembolic diseasearthritislupusgoutthyroiditisserum sickness-like reactionsserotonin syndromeneuroleptic malignant syndromeDiagnosisDiagnosing a persistent low grade fever may involve several different tests to eliminate potential causes.The doctor will generally carry out a physical examination and question the person regarding additional symptoms and whether they have any chronic conditions.The doctor may also ask about any medications that the person takes so that they can eliminate them as a cause of the fever.They may order blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC), to get an overview of the person’s health. The results may help them decide which other tests, if any, they need to order.If the doctor suspects that the person has a UTI, they may ask them for a sample of their urine to test.TreatmentsShare on PinterestOTC drugs may help treat a low grade fever at home.Treatment for a persistent low grade fever will depend on the cause. For instance, minor infections may not need treatment at all, whereas issues such as cancer require extensive treatment.To alleviate the symptoms of a low grade fever at home, a person can try over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).A fever can cause dehydration, so it is vital to drink plenty of water.It is important to treat a low grade fever in children, who may be more sensitive to temperature changes. Using children’s versions of OTC drugs may help control the fever while waiting to see a doctor.OutlookA persistent low grade fever is a sign of an underlying issue, such as a mild infection or chronic condition. The fever may persist while the person is fighting off the infection.For the most part, persistent low grade fevers are not a cause for concern. However, it is important to monitor the fever to see whether it gets worse.Anyone who is concerned about their symptoms or experiences a persistent low grade fever for more than 10 days should see a doctor.SHOP FOR OTC DRUGSThe drugs listed in this article are available online:IbuprofenAcetaminophenFlu / Cold / SARSImmune System / VaccinesInfectious Diseases / Bacteria / VirusesHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

It’s common in both children and adults and usually goes away on its own within a few days. If it doesn’t improve or if you’re experiencing other symptoms like a fever or bloody stool, reach out to a provider to get the treatment (and relief) you need.ContentsArrow DownOverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionLiving WithContentsArrow DownOverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionLiving WithOverviewGerms, diseases affecting your gut and even treatments can all cause diarrhea.What is diarrhea?Diarrhea means having a loose or watery stool (poop). It’s so common that most people flinch when they hear the word. The thought of thin, sickly-looking poop in the toilet bowl never stops feeling unpleasant. If you have diarrhea, not knowing what’s causing it or how long it’ll last only adds stress to the unpleasant feelings.The good news is that diarrhea is usually mild (only a few bathroom trips a day) and goes away within a few days.Sometimes, though, diarrhea is a sign of a serious condition. It can cause you to lose too much fluid (dehydration) or prevent you from getting enough nutrients. It’s important to know what to look out for so you know when to see a healthcare provider about diarrhea and when to wait it out.Types of diarrheaDiarrhea goes by different names depending on how long it lasts:Acute diarrhea: Acute diarrhea is loose, watery diarrhea that lasts one to two days. It’s the most common type and usually goes away without treatment.Persistent diarrhea: Persistent diarrhea lasts about two to four weeks.Chronic diarrhea: Chronic diarrhea lasts more than four weeks or comes and goes regularly over a long period. Diarrhea that lasts this long may indicate a more serious condition that warrants a visit with your healthcare provider.How common is diarrhea?It’s incredibly common and affects people of all ages. Most adults get acute diarrhea once a year, while children tend to get it twice a year.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicySymptoms and CausesWhat causes diarrhea?The main cause of diarrhea is a virus that infects your gut (gastroenteritis). Some call it the “stomach flu” or a “stomach bug.” But diarrhea can have lots of causes.Infections. Pathogens (viruses, bacteria and parasites) can all cause infections that lead to diarrhea. The most common cause of diarrhea in adults is the norovirus that causes gastroenteritis. Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children.Food poisoning. You can ingest harmful toxins and pathogens from contaminated foods or drinks. Once they’re in your gut, the toxins or germs can cause diarrhea. “Traveler’s diarrhea” is when you get diarrhea while traveling in a new environment with poor hygiene or sanitation. Usually, it’s exposure to bacteria that gives you diarrhea.Medications. Diarrhea is a common medication side effect. For example, antibiotics kill harmful bacteria that make you sick, but they can destroy helpful bacteria in the process. Not having enough good bacteria can lead to diarrhea. Diarrhea is also a side effect of antacids with magnesium and some cancer drugs and treatments. Overusing laxatives can also cause diarrhea.Foods that upset your digestive system. If you’re lactose intolerant, you get diarrhea because your body struggles to digest lactose, the sugar in dairy. Some people have trouble digesting fructose, a sugar in honey and fruits that’s added as a sweetener to some foods. With celiac disease, you get diarrhea because your body has trouble breaking down gluten, a protein in wheat.Diseases affecting your bowels. Diarrhea is a common symptom of conditions that cause irritation and inflammation in your bowels (intestines). Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can all cause diarrhea. Stress and anxiety can worsen symptoms if you have a condition like IBS.Procedures on your bowels. Many people have diarrhea after surgery on their bowels. It may take a while for your digestive tract to absorb nutrients from the foods you’re eating and create firm stools from the waste.What are the symptoms of diarrhea?The main sign of diarrhea is loose or watery stool. Other common symptoms include:Bloating or cramps in your belly.A strong and urgent need to poop.Nausea (upset stomach).These symptoms usually don’t require a provider visit, especially if they only last a few days.Signs and symptoms of severe diarrheaSevere cases of diarrhea may signal a medical condition, like a serious infection, that won’t get better without treatment from a healthcare provider.Contact your provider if you have diarrhea with:Fever.Severe pain.Vomiting.Blood or mucus in your stool.Weight loss (this can be a sign that your body’s not absorbing enough nutrients).Contact a provider if you’re experiencing symptoms of dehydration or noticing signs of dehydration in your child, including:Headache.Flushed, dry skin.Irritability and confusion.Severe nausea and vomiting.Light-headedness and dizziness.Fatigue (tiredness that doesn’t improve with rest).Dark pee, small amounts of pee or no peeing at all.Fewer than six wet diapers a day (infants).No wet diapers or peeing for eight hours (toddlers).No tears when crying (infants and toddlers).AdvertisementWhat are the complications of diarrhea?Dehydration is one of the biggest concerns with diarrhea. This is especially true among vulnerable populations (infants, people 65 and older and people with compromised immune systems). Without treatment, dehydration can lead to kidney failure, stroke, heart attack or even death.Diagnosis and TestsHow is diarrhea diagnosed?Most cases of diarrhea don’t require a diagnosis or treatment. In more severe cases, your provider will work to determine the cause. They’ll ask about your medical history, family medical history, travel history and any sick contacts you may have.They may order tests, including:Blood tests to rule out certain conditions that cause diarrhea.A stool test to check for blood, bacterial infections and parasites.A hydrogen breath test to check for lactose or fructose intolerance and bacterial overgrowth.An endoscopy of your upper and lower digestive tract to rule out growths or other structural issues that can cause diarrhea, like ulcers or tumors.AdvertisementManagement and TreatmentHow is diarrhea treated?Usually, you can get rid of diarrhea at home. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines for diarrhea, like bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol® or Kaopectate®), often help people feel better quickly. You’ll need to see a healthcare provider for diarrhea that doesn’t improve or that happens alongside symptoms of severe diarrhea.Your provider may recommend treatments like:Antibiotics or antiparasitics. These drugs kill infection-causing germs.Medications that treat chronic conditions. Treating underlying conditions that cause diarrhea, like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and IBS, can help.Probiotics. Probiotics introduce good bacteria into your gut to combat diarrhea. Your healthcare provider may suggest you try them. Always talk to your provider before starting a probiotic or any supplement.Can I stop diarrhea without taking anti-diarrhea medicine?You can often get rid of acute diarrhea through lifestyle changes you can make at home.Drink plenty of water and other electrolyte-balanced fluids. These include diluted and pulp-free fruit juices, broths, sports drinks (Gatorade®) and caffeine-free sodas. These drinks replace lost water and electrolytes you’re losing with diarrhea. Electrolytes are substances that help with important processes, like maintaining the balance of fluids in your body.Choose foods that can firm your stools. Certain low-fiber foods make stools more solid. Try the BRAT diet: (B)ananas, white (R)ice, (A)pplesauce and (T)oast. Potatoes, noodles, lean beef, fish and chicken or turkey without the skin are also good options. Changing your diet can make a huge difference when it comes to getting relief.Avoid caffeine and alcohol. Caffeinated foods and drinks can have a mild laxative effect that worsens diarrhea. Steer clear of coffee, sodas, strong tea/green tea and chocolate. Avoid alcohol, which can lead to dehydration.Avoid foods and drinks that give you gas. Avoid beans, cabbage, brussels sprouts, beer and carbonated beverages to prevent stomach cramps. Sometimes, diarrhea can make you temporarily lactose intolerant. Avoiding dairy until your diarrhea clears is a good idea.How can I relieve discomfort caused by diarrhea?Diarrhea can cause your anus (butthole) to feel sore, itchy or like it’s burning. It may hurt to poop. You can ease the pain by sitting in lukewarm water in the bathtub or trying a sitz bath. Pat your anus dry instead of rubbing it when you get out of the water. Applying petroleum jelly or a hemorrhoid cream to your anus can keep it from getting too raw.What do I do if my baby or young child has diarrhea?Call your child’s pediatrician if they have severe diarrhea. Treatments for diarrhea in children are different from treatments for adults. Over-the-counter medications may be dangerous.Children are also at a higher risk of dehydration than adults. Your provider will help you determine the best way to keep them hydrated, but options include:Breast (chest) milk.Formula.Electrolyte drinks (Pedialyte®) for older children. (Providers don’t recommend this for babies.)The best option to keep your child hydrated might change as the child gets older. Always check with a provider before giving your child a new liquid or treatment of any kind.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentPreventionCan diarrhea be prevented?\u200b\u200bYou can’t always prevent diarrhea, but you can reduce your risk of getting it because of infections or food contamination.Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom or preparing and eating food. Another option is to use hand sanitizer.Get vaccinated: The rotavirus vaccine prevents rotavirus, a common cause of diarrhea. The vaccine for COVID-19 can reduce your risk of getting COVID and experiencing COVID symptoms, including diarrhea.Store food properly: Store food at the correct temperatures, and cook all foods until they reach the recommended temperatures. Don’t take chances by consuming foods or drinks past their expiration dates.Watch what you drink when you travel: Don’t drink untreated water when you travel. Avoid tap water, ice cubes or brushing your teeth with tap water. Steer clear of unpasteurized milk or juice products. Pasteurization is a process that kills germs in certain drinks. When in doubt, drink bottled water or something that’s been boiled first (coffee or tea).Watch what you eat when you travel. Avoid raw or undercooked meats (and shellfish), as well as raw fruits and vegetables. Fruits and veggies are usually healthy options, but the skin may contain contaminants that can make you sick.Living WithWhen should I call my doctor about diarrhea?Call your healthcare provider if you have diarrhea that doesn’t improve or go away within a few days. Reach out if you have a fever, severe pain and a bloody stool in addition to diarrhea.See a healthcare provider if you’re experiencing symptoms of dehydration, which can be serious without treatment.A note from Cleveland ClinicGoing to the bathroom, having a bowel movement, pooping — no matter what you call it, stool is a regular part of life. That’s a big reason why diarrhea is so uncomfortable. It messes up our normal. Usually, diarrhea is a short-term thing that resolves in a few days. If it doesn’t, or if you’re experiencing symptoms of severe diarrhea, contact your healthcare provider. And don’t be embarrassed. Diarrhea is a common condition your provider knows all about. They can advise you on the best ways to get relief fast.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 09/20/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Article Sections
Acute diarrhea in adults is a common problem encountered by family physicians. The most common etiology is viral gastroenteritis, a self-limited disease. Increases in travel, comorbidities, and foodborne illness lead to more bacteria-related cases of acute diarrhea. A history and physical examination evaluating for risk factors and signs of inflammatory diarrhea and/or severe dehydration can direct any needed testing and treatment. Most patients do not require laboratory workup, and routine stool cultures are not recommended. Treatment focuses on preventing and treating dehydration. Diagnostic investigation should be reserved for patients with severe dehydration or illness, persistent fever, bloody stool, or immunosuppression, and for cases of suspected nosocomial infection or outbreak. Oral rehydration therapy with early refeeding is the preferred treatment for dehydration. Antimotility agents should be avoided in patients with bloody diarrhea, but loperamide/simethicone may improve symptoms in patients with watery diarrhea. Probiotic use may shorten the duration of illness. When used appropriately, antibiotics are effective in the treatment of shigellosis, campylobacteriosis, Clostridium difficile, traveler's diarrhea, and protozoal infections. Prevention of acute diarrhea is promoted through adequate hand washing, safe food preparation, access to clean water, and vaccinations.
Acute diarrhea is defined as stool with increased water content, volume, or frequency that lasts less than 14 days.1 Diarrheal illness accounts for 2.5 million deaths per year worldwide.2 In the United States, an estimated 48 million foodborne diarrheal illnesses occur annually, resulting in more than 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths.3,4 In the developing world, infectious causes of acute diarrhea are largely related to contaminated food and water supplies.5 In the developed world, technological progress and an increase in mass production of food have paradoxically contributed to the persistence of foodborne illness, despite higher standards of food production.6
Clinical recommendationEvidence ratingReferencesIn patients with acute diarrhea, stool cultures should be reserved for grossly bloody stool, severe dehydration, signs of inflammatory disease, symptoms lasting more than three to seven days, immunosuppression, and suspected nosocomial infections.C25, 26 Testing for Clostridium difficile toxins A and B should be performed in patients who develop unexplained diarrhea after three days of hospitalization.C25, 27 Routine testing for ova and parasites in acute diarrhea is not necessary in developed countries, unless the patient is in a high-risk group (i.e., diarrhea lasting more than seven days, especially if associated with infants in day care or travel to mountainous regions; diarrhea in patients with AIDS or men who have sex with men; community waterborne outbreaks; or bloody diarrhea with few fecal leukocytes).C11, 29 The first step to treating acute diarrhea is rehydration, preferably oral rehydration.C1 Combination loperamide/simethicone may provide faster and more complete relief of acute nonspecific diarrhea and gas-related discomfort than either medication alone.B39 Antibiotics (usually a quinolone) reduce the duration and severity of traveler's diarrhea.A42
Differential Diagnosis
Infectious causes of acute diarrhea include viruses, bacteria, and, less often, parasites. Noninfectious causes include medication adverse effects, acute abdominal processes, gastroenterologic disease, and endocrine disease.
Clinically, acute infectious diarrhea is classified into two pathophysiologic syndromes, commonly referred to as noninflammatory (mostly viral, milder disease) and inflammatory (mostly invasive or with toxin-producing bacteria, more severe disease).7,8 Table 1 compares noninflammatory and inflammatory acute infectious diarrhea.7,8

Viral infections are the most common cause of acute diarrhea.9 Bacterial infections are more often associated with travel, comorbidities, and foodborne illness. When a specific organism is identified, the most common causes of acute diarrhea in the United States are Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, and Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (enterohemorrhagic E. coli).10 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a comprehensive list of foodborne illnesses at http://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/diseases.
History and Physical Examination
HISTORY
The onset, duration, severity, and frequency of diarrhea should be noted, with particular attention to stool character (e.g., watery, bloody, mucus-filled, purulent, bilious). The patient should be evaluated for signs of dehydration, including decreased urine output, thirst, dizziness, and change in mental status. Vomiting is more suggestive of viral illness or illness caused by ingestion of a preformed bacterial toxin. Symptoms more suggestive of invasive bacterial (inflammatory) diarrhea include fever, tenesmus, and grossly bloody stool.11
A food and travel history is helpful to evaluate potential exposures. Children in day care, nursing home residents, food handlers, and recently hospitalized patients are at high risk of infectious diarrheal illness. Pregnant women have a 12-fold increased risk of listeriosis,12 which is primarily contracted by consuming cold meats, soft cheeses, and raw milk.13 Recent sick contacts and use of antibiotics and other medications should be noted in patients with acute diarrhea. Sexual practices that include receptive anal and oral-anal contact increase the possibility of direct rectal inoculation and fecal-oral transmission.
The history should also include gastroenterologic disease or surgery; endocrine disease; radiation to the pelvis; and factors that increase the risk of immunosuppression, including human immunodeficiency virus infection, long-term steroid use, chemotherapy, and immunoglobulin A deficiency. History findings associated with causes of diarrhea are summarized in Table 2,1,7,8,14,15 and clinical features by pathogen are summarized in Table 3.1,14

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The primary goal of the physical examination is to assess the patient's degree of dehydration. Generally ill appearance, dry mucous membranes, delayed capillary refill time, increased heart rate, and abnormal orthostatic vital signs can be helpful in identifying more severe dehydration. Fever is more suggestive of inflammatory diarrhea. The abdominal examination is important to assess for pain and acute abdominal processes. A rectal examination may be helpful in assessing for blood, rectal tenderness, and stool consistency.
Diagnostic Testing
Because most watery diarrhea is self-limited, testing is usually not indicated.1,16 In general, specific diagnostic investigation can be reserved for patients with severe dehydration, more severe illness, persistent fever, bloody stool, or immunosuppression, and for cases of suspected nosocomial infection or outbreak.
OCCULT BLOOD
It is unclear how much fecal occult blood testing affects pretest probability. Nevertheless, it is a rapid and inexpensive test, and when tests are positive for fecal occult blood in conjunction with the presence of fecal leukocytes or lactoferrin, the diagnosis of inflammatory diarrhea is more common.17 Of note, fecal occult blood testing is 71% sensitive and 79% specific for inflammatory diarrhea in developed countries, but the sensitivity drops to 44% and specificity to 72% in developing countries.18
LEUKOCYTES AND LACTOFERRIN
Testing stool for leukocytes to screen for inflammatory diarrhea poses several challenges, including the handling of specimens and the standardization of laboratory processing and interpretation. There is a wide variability in sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, this testing has fallen out of favor.18
Lactoferrin is a marker for leukocytes that is released by damaged or deteriorating cells, and increases in the setting of bacterial infections.19 Commercially available immunoassay testing kits are a more precise and less variable method for specimen analysis compared with fecal leukocytes, with a sensitivity greater than 90% and a specificity greater than 70%.20 Although there is some debate as to whether fecal lactoferrin is clearly superior to fecal leukocytes, the speed and simplicity of lactoferrin testing make it the preferred method to screen for the presence of leukocytes when indicated.21
STOOL CULTURES
The indiscriminate use of stool cultures in the evaluation of acute diarrhea is inefficient (results are positive in only 1.6% to 5.6% of cases)1 and expensive, with an estimated cost of $900 to $1,200 per positive stool culture.22 Obtaining cultures only in patients with screening tests positive for leukocytes decreases the cost to $150 per positive culture.23 Obtaining cultures only in patients with grossly bloody stools increases the yield for positive culture results to greater than 30%.24
Although there is no consensus on which patients need a culture, it is reasonable to perform a culture if the patient has grossly bloody stool, severe dehydration, signs of inflammatory disease, symptoms lasting more than three to seven days, or immunosuppression.25,26 Cultures are often obtained for traveler's diarrhea; however, empiric treatment is also an option.1,11 In the hospital setting, cultures should be reserved for the reasons listed above or if diarrhea begins more than three days after admission and there has been a nosocomial outbreak, the patient has human immunodeficiency virus infection or neutropenia, or the patient is older than 65 years with significant comorbidity (e.g., end-stage liver, renal, or pulmonary disease; leukemia hemiparesis caused by cardiovascular accident; inflammatory bowel disease).25
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TESTING
Testing for Clostridium difficile toxins A and B is recommended for patients who develop unexplained diarrhea after three days of hospitalization; the test will be positive in 15% to 20% of these patients.25,27 Furthermore, the risk of contracting C. difficile infection increases by seven to 10 times throughout any period of antibiotic treatment and for the first month after antibiotic discontinuation, and this risk is still three times higher in the second and third months after antibiotic discontinuation.28 Therefore, testing for C. difficile toxins is also suggested in patients who develop unexplained diarrhea while using antibiotics or within three months of discontinuing antibiotics. C. difficile testing can be considered in certain populations with significant comorbidities, including older persons and those who are immunocompromised.
OVA AND PARASITES
Routine analysis for ova and parasites in patients with acute diarrhea is not cost-effective, especially in developed countries.29 Indications for ova and parasite testing include persistent diarrhea lasting more than seven days, especially if associated with infants in day care or travel to mountainous regions; diarrhea in persons with AIDS or men who have sex with men; community waterborne outbreaks; or bloody diarrhea with few fecal leukocytes.11 The benefit of sending multiple samples to increase the test yield is debatable.
ENDOSCOPY
The role of endoscopy in the diagnosis and management of acute diarrhea is limited. Endoscopic evaluation may be considered if the diagnosis is unclear after routine blood and stool tests, if empiric therapy is ineffective, or if symptoms persist.30 Specifically, lower endoscopy with colonic biopsy and culture can be helpful in patients with diarrhea and suspected tuberculosis or diffuse colitis (as in C. difficile colitis) and in determining noninfectious causes of acute diarrhea, such as inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic colitis, enteropathy related to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and cancer.31
Treatment
Figure 1 provides an algorithm for the treatment of acute diarrhea.1,14,20
REHYDRATION THERAPY
The first step to treating acute diarrhea is rehydration, preferably oral rehydration.1 The accumulated fluid deficit (calculated roughly as the difference between the patient's normal weight and his or her weight at presentation with diarrheal illness) must first be addressed. Next, the focus should turn to the replacement of ongoing losses and the continuation of maintenance fluids. An oral rehydration solution (ORS) must contain a mixture of salt and glucose in combination with water to best use the intestine's sodium-glucose coupled cellular transport mechanism.
In 2002, the World Health Organization endorsed an ORS with reduced osmolarity (250 mOsm per L or less compared with the prior standard of 311 mOsm per L). The reduced osmolarity ORS decreases stool outputs, episodes of emesis, and the need for intravenous rehydration,32 without increasing hyponatremia, compared with the standard ORS.33 A reduced osmolarity ORS can be roughly duplicated by mixing 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 6 teaspoons of sugar, and 1 liter of water. If oral rehydration is not feasible, intravenous rehydration may be necessary.
FEEDING
Early refeeding decreases intestinal permeability caused by infections, reduces illness duration, and improves nutritional outcomes.34,35 This is particularly important in developing countries where underlying preexisting malnutrition is often a factor. Although the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) and the avoidance of dairy are commonly recommended, supporting data for these interventions are limited. Instructing patients to refrain from eating solid food for 24 hours also does not appear useful.36
ANTIDIARRHEAL MEDICATIONS
The antimotility agent loperamide (Imodium) may reduce the duration of diarrhea by as much as one day and increase the likelihood of clinical cure at 24 and 48 hours when given with antibiotics for traveler's diarrhea.37,38 A loperamide/simethicone combination has demonstrated faster and more complete relief of acute nonspecific diarrhea and gas-related discomfort compared with either medication alone.39
Loperamide may cause dangerous prolongation of illness in patients with some forms of bloody or inflammatory diarrhea and, therefore, should be restricted to patients with nonbloody stool.40 The antisecretory drug bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) is a safe alternative in patients with fever and inflammatory diarrhea. There is inadequate evidence to recommend the use of the absorbents kaolin/pectin, activated charcoal, or attapulgite (no longer available in the United States). The antisecretory drug racecadotril, widely used in Europe but unavailable in the United States, appears to be more tolerable and as effective as loperamide.41
ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY
Because acute diarrhea is most often self-limited and caused by viruses, routine antibiotic use is not recommended for most adults with nonsevere, watery diarrhea. Additionally, the overuse of antibiotics can lead to resistance (e.g., Campylobacter), harmful eradication of normal flora, prolongation of illness (e.g., superinfection with C. difficile), prolongation of carrier state (e.g., delayed excretion of Salmonella), induction of Shiga toxins (e.g., from Shiga toxin–producing E. coli), and increased cost.
However, when used appropriately, antibiotics are effective for shigellosis, campylobacteriosis, C. difficile, traveler's diarrhea, and protozoal infections. Antibiotic treatment of traveler's diarrhea (usually a quinolone) is associated with decreased severity of illness and a two-or three-day reduction in duration of illness.1,42 If the patient's clinical presentation suggests the possibility of Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (e.g., bloody diarrhea, history of eating seed sprouts or rare ground beef, proximity to an outbreak), antibiotic use should be avoided because it may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome.43 Conservative management without antibiotic treatment is less successful for diarrhea lasting more than 10 to 14 days, and testing and treatment for protozoal infections should be considered.1 Antibiotics may be considered in patients who are older than 65 years, immunocompromised, severely ill, or septic. Table 4 summarizes antibiotic therapy for acute diarrhea.1,14,16,44,45

PROBIOTICS
Probiotics are thought to work by stimulating the immune system and competing for binding sites on intestinal epithelial cells. Their use in children with acute diarrhea is associated with reduced severity and duration of illness (an average of about one less day of illness).46 Although many species are generally categorized as probiotics, even closely related strains may have different clinical effects. Effects of strain-specific probiotics need to be verified in adult studies before a specific evidence-based recommendation can be made.16
ZINC SUPPLEMENTATION
Research in children suggests that zinc supplementation (20 mg per day for 10 days in children older than two months) may play a crucial role in treating and preventing acute diarrhea, particularly in developing countries. Studies demonstrate a decrease in the risk of dehydration, and in the duration and severity of the diarrheal episode by an estimated 20% to 40%.47 Additional research is needed to evaluate potential benefits of zinc supplementation in the adult population.
Prevention
Good hygiene, hand washing, safe food preparation, and access to clean water are key factors in preventing diarrheal illness.48 Public health interventions to promote hand washing alone can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about one-third.49 Vaccine development remains a high priority for disease prevention, particularly for those in the developing world. Effective and safe vaccines exist for rotavirus, typhoid fever, and cholera, and are under investigation for Campylobacter, enterotoxigenic E. coli, and Shigella infections. To contain disease outbreaks, designated diseases should be reported to public health authorities. In the United States, reportable diarrheal illnesses include those caused by Vibrio cholerae, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Shiga toxin–producing E. coli.
