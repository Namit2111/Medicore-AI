Updated on January 6, 2023Body temperatureAdultsChildrenBabiesDuring pregnancyHow to measureWhat to doWhen to see a doctorWhat affects temperature?Symptoms of a feverSummaryThe average adult body temperature is around 98.6ï¿½F (37ï¿½C), but individual baseline body temperatures can vary. Factors such as age and activity levels can affect a personï¿½s normal body temperature.The way of measuring temperature may also affect the reading. In this article, we discuss typical temperature ranges for adults, children, and those who are pregnant. We also consider factors affecting body temperature and when to call a doctor.Body temperatureShare on PinterestAnna Efetova/Getty ImagesBody temperature readings vary depending on where a person takes the measurements on the body. For example, rectal temperature readings are higher than oral readings, while armpit readings tend to be lower.Body temperature readings can also vary depending on the following factors:a personï¿½s agethe time of day, typically lowest in the early morning and highest in the late afternoona personï¿½s recent activityfood and fluid intakeNormal temperature in adultsAccording to reviews, the average adult body temperature across all different reading sites is 97.86ï¿½F (36.59ï¿½C).Researchers also found that the average orally-taken adult body temperature falls between 97.2ï¿½98.6ï¿½F (36.24ï¿½37ï¿½C).Average body temperature can vary across demographics. A study of almost 35,500 people found that older adults had the lowest temperatures, and African American women had higher temperatures than white men.The researchers also found that certain medical conditions can affect body temperature. For example, people with an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) tended to have lower temperatures, while people with cancer had higher temperatures.Typically, the following temperatures suggest that someone has a fever:at least 100.4ï¿½F (38ï¿½C) is a feverabove 103.1ï¿½F (39.5ï¿½C) is a high feverabove 105.8ï¿½F (41ï¿½C) is a very high feverA fever may be a symptom of COVID-19.Coronavirus resourcesFor more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.Normal temperature in childrenThe average body temperature for children is around 97.52ï¿½F (36.4ï¿½C), but this can vary. As with adults, a temperature above 100.4ï¿½F (38ï¿½C) may indicate a fever in children.Normal temperature in babiesInfants tend to have higher body temperatures than older children and adults. The average body temperature for newborn babies is around 99.5ï¿½F (37.5ï¿½C).A babyï¿½s temperature is higher because they have a larger body surface area relative to their body weight. Their bodies are also more metabolically active, which generates heat.Babiesï¿½ bodies do not regulate temperature as well as adultsï¿½ bodies. They sweat less when it is warm, meaning their bodies hold more heat. It may also be more difficult for them to cool down during a fever.Learn more about fever in babies here.Normal temperatures during pregnancyDuring pregnancy, a personï¿½s basal metabolic rate (BMR) is higher. This means the body produces more heat.One study found that body temperature peaks at 96ï¿½99.5ï¿½F (35.6ï¿½37.5ï¿½C) around the 12th week of pregnancy. The average body temperature reaches its lowest point of around 95.5ï¿½99.1ï¿½F (35.3ï¿½37.3ï¿½C) just after the 33rd week.How to take your temperatureThere are many types of thermometers available.Digital thermometersDigital thermometers are readily available and can produce accurate temperature results. A person may use these at different parts of the body.Rectal measurement: Specialized digital rectal thermometers are a common option for taking the temperature of young children. A person should clean and lubricate the end of these devices before inserting them into the anus. The device will alert the user when it has made a reading and is safe to remove.Oral measurement: Standard digital thermometers are simple to use orally (by mouth). First, a person must make sure the tip of the device is clean. They will then place this under their tongue toward the back of their mouth and close their lips. The device will produce a reading on an integrated display.Axillary (armpit) measurement: A person can place a digital thermometer at their, or someone elseï¿½s, armpit. The arm must then remain tight to the body to ensure a good reading. This is a noninvasive option for taking a childï¿½s temperature.Infrared thermometersInfrared thermometers can take temperature readings at a distance. However, these are not as accurate as other methods. People may use tympanic thermometers to take readings from the ear canal. To use, a person will: insert the deviceï¿½s tip into their earalign it with their ear canalactivate the device until it produces a resultTemporal thermometers use an infrared signal to measure a personï¿½s temperature. The user will typically hold the thermometer a few centimeters from a personï¿½s forehead and wait for the device to produce a reading.One study concluded that while forehead and ear measurements are viable, nontraumatic screening options for infants, they are still not as accurate as rectal measurements.It is important for people to always follow the instructions on the thermometer package.What to do when body temperature is too low or too highIf a thermometer indicates a personï¿½s body temperature is too high or too low, they may wish to take another reading to confirm the result.In all age ranges, a high temperature may result from short-term illnesses and usually does not cause significant harm in adults with otherwise good overall health.If a person has a high temperature, it is important they rest and drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. These at-home treatments also apply to children and babies.In hot climates, exercise or other physical activity may cause hyperthermia ï¿½ an abnormally high body temperature. Unlike infection or fever, this is typically the result of outside factors. Moving to a cooler space and taking fluids will usually remedy hyperthermia.However, if a high temperature persists or increases, people should seek medical help.If a personï¿½s temperature is below 95ï¿½F (35ï¿½C) they have hypothermia and should seek medical assistance.When to contact a doctorThe need for medical assistance can vary between age groups.AdultsIn many cases, a person with a fever will not require medical attention. However, if a person has a temperature of
or higher, they should contact their doctor.A person should also seek medical assistance if they experience any of the following alongside a fever:dehydrationlightheadednesssevere crampsa persistent, or worsening feverThe following people should also seek medical assistance if they experience fever:recent transplant participantspeople with compromised immune systemsthose on immunosuppressantsthose who have recently undergone cancer treatmentsIf a personï¿½s temperature is over 106.7ï¿½F (41.5ï¿½C), they have hyperpyrexia, a very high fever. This can lead to permanent organ damage and death. Hyperpyrexia requires urgent medical assistance.If a personï¿½s body temperature is too low, they may have hypothermia. This is a medical emergency, and they should seek assistance immediately. Doctors define hypothermia as a temperature dropping below 95ï¿½F (35ï¿½C).ChildrenA person should contact emergency services if a child has a temperature over 104ï¿½F (40ï¿½C). They should also seek medical help if a child has a high temperature that lasts for 5 days or more or is experiencing dehydration, vomiting, or diarrhea.If a childï¿½s temperature drops below 95ï¿½F (35ï¿½C), medical assistance is essential.BabiesIf an infant 3 months or younger has a temperature of 100.4ï¿½F (38ï¿½C) or above, seek emergency medical attention. In young babies, a slight fever can signal a serious infection. In babies up to 6 months of age, a temperature of 102.2ï¿½F (39ï¿½C) or more is also reason to contact emergency services.As with adults and older children, if a babyï¿½s temperature drops below 95ï¿½F (35ï¿½C), they will require immediate emergency assistance.What causes body temperature to change?An area of the brain called the hypothalamus regulates body temperature. If body temperature rises above or dips below the 98.6ï¿½F (37ï¿½C) mark, the hypothalamus works to regulate the temperature.If the body is too cold, the hypothalamus sends signals to make the body shiver, which warms the body. If the body is too hot, it sends messages to begin sweating, letting heat leave the body.Infections cause most fevers. A fever develops as the bodyï¿½s natural way of reacting to and fighting infection.Symptoms of a feverDoctors consider a fever to be a body temperature that reaches or exceeds 100.4ï¿½F (38ï¿½C). Other symptoms include:appetite losschillsheadacheirritabilitymuscle achesshiveringsweatingweaknessSummaryThe ideal body temperature in adults is around 98.6ï¿½F (37ï¿½C), but this varies based on age, physical activity, and health. Body temperature also changes throughout the day. A temperature of above 100.4ï¿½F (38ï¿½C) signals a fever.Babies may have higher body temperatures than adults, but even a slight fever in babies can indicate a severe infection.Temperature readings from different body parts give a range of body temperatures that doctors consider normal. Rectal readings are higher than oral readings, and armpit readings tend to be lower.If a person has an unusually high or low temperature, they should seek medical attention immediately.Read this article in Spanish.Public HealthBiology / BiochemistryImmune System / VaccinesHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

UniversityReviewed/Revised Jul 2024VIEW PROFESSIONAL VERSIONGET THE QUICK FACTSCauses|Evaluation|Treatment|Essentials for Older People|Key Points|Fever is an elevated body temperature that occurs when the body's thermostat (located in the hypothalamus in the brain) resets at a higher temperature, primarily in response to an infection. Elevated body temperature that is not caused by a resetting of the temperature set point is called hyperthermia. Although 98.6ï¿½ F (37ï¿½ C) is considered normal temperature, body temperature varies throughout the day. It is lowest in the early morning and highest in the late afternoonï¿½sometimes reaching 99.9ï¿½ F (37.7ï¿½ C). Similarly, a fever does not stay at a constant temperature. Sometimes temperature peaks every day and then returns to normal. This process is called intermittent fever. Alternatively, temperature varies but does not return to normal. This process is called remittent fever. Doctors no longer think that the pattern of the rise and fall of fever is very important in the diagnosis of certain disorders.Body temperature can be measured at several areas of the body. The most common sites are the mouth (oral temperature) and rectum (rectal temperature). Other sites include the ear, forehead, and, much less preferably, armpit. Temperature is typically measured using a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers containing mercury are not recommended because they can break and expose people to mercury.Oral temperatures are considered elevated whenThey are higher than 99ï¿½ F (37ï¿½ C) in the early morning.They are higher than 100.4ï¿½ F (38ï¿½ C) at any time after the early morning.They are higher than a personï¿½s known normal everyday temperature.Rectal and ear temperatures are about 1.0ï¿½ F (0.6ï¿½ C) higher than oral temperatures. Skin temperatures (for example, the forehead) are about 1.0ï¿½ F (0.6ï¿½ C) lower than oral temperatures. Many people use the term ï¿½feverï¿½ loosely, often meaning that they feel too warm, too cold, or sweaty, but they have not actually measured their temperature.The ability to generate a fever is reduced in certain people (for example, those who are very old, very young, or who have an alcohol use disorder).(See also Overview of Infectious Disease and Fever in Infants and Children.)Consequences of feverThe symptoms people have are due mainly to the condition causing the fever rather than the fever itself.Although many people worry that fever can cause harm, the typical temporary elevations in body temperature ranging from 100.4ï¿½ to 104ï¿½ F (38ï¿½ to 40ï¿½ C) caused by most short-lived (acute) infections are well-tolerated by healthy adults. As one of the body's defenses against an infection, a fever can trigger the production of antibodies and make it more difficult for microorganisms to grow, and may lessen the severity of an infection and help it go away. However, a moderate fever may be slightly dangerous for adults with a heart or lung disorder because fever causes the heart rate and breathing rate to increase. Fever can also worsen mental status in people with dementia.Additionally, an extreme temperature elevation (typically more than 105.8ï¿½ F, or 41ï¿½ C) may be damaging. A body temperature this high can cause malfunction and ultimately failure of most organs. Such extreme elevation sometimes results from very severe infection (such as sepsis, malaria, or meningitis) but is more typically caused by heatstroke or use of certain illicit drugs (such as
or PCP).Fever in healthy children can cause febrile seizures.Causes of Fever in AdultsSubstances that cause fever are called pyrogens. Pyrogens can come from inside or outside the body. Microorganisms and the substances they produce (such as toxins) are examples of pyrogens formed outside the body. Pyrogens formed inside the body are usually produced by 2 types of white blood cells called monocytes and macrophages. Pyrogens from outside the body can cause fever by stimulating the body to release its own pyrogens or by directly affecting the area of the brain that controls temperature.Many disorders can cause fever. They are broadly categorized asInfectious (most common)Neoplastic (cancer)Inflammatory (including autoimmune disorders, allergic reactions, and some drug reactions)An infectious cause is highly likely in adults with a fever that lasts 4 days or less (called an acute fever). An acute fever in people with cancer or a known inflammatory disorder also is most likely to have an infectious cause. In healthy people, an acute fever is unlikely to be the first sign of a chronic illness. A noninfectious cause is more likely to cause fever that lasts a long time or returns. Infectious causesInfections are the most common causes of fever. Infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Virtually all infections can cause fever, but, overall, the most likely infectious causes are the following:Upper and lower respiratory tract infectionsGastrointestinal infectionsUrinary tract infections (UTIs)Skin infectionsMost acute respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections are viral.Neoplastic causesMany cancers cause fever, for example, leukemia, lymphoma, and kidney cancer. Inflammatory causesInflammatory disorders that cause fever include systemic rheumatic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), and giant cell arteritis. Fever may also result from an allergic reaction.Medications and drugs sometimes cause fever. For example, beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin) and sulfa medications can trigger a fever. Certain illicit drugs (such as , amphetamines, or phencyclidine) and medications such as anesthetics and antipsychotics can cause an extremely high temperature.Risk factorsCertain factors help doctors determine what is the most likely cause of fever in a person. These factors include the following:The person's health status, age, and occupationHospitalizationUse of certain medications or illicit drugsExposure to infections (for example, through travel or contact with infected people, animals, or insects)Table Some Causes of Fever Based on Risk FactorsRisk FactorCauseNone (healthy)Upper or lower respiratory tract infectionGastrointestinal infectionUrinary tract infectionSkin infectionHospitalizationBloodstream infection related to a catheter inserted in a vein (IV catheter infection)Urinary tract infection, particularly in people with a urinary catheterPneumonia, particularly in people on a ventilatorAtelectasis (collapse of part of a lung due to an airway blockage, rather than an infection)Infection or a pocket of blood (hematoma) at the site of surgeryDeep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolismDiarrhea (due to Clostridioides difficileï¿½induced colitis)MedicationsTransfusion reactionPressure soresTravel to areas where an infection is common (endemic areas)MalariaViral hepatitisDisorders that cause diarrheaTyphoid feverZika virus, chikungunya, Ebola virus, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, measles, and yellow feverDengue feverFungal infections such as coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, or histoplasmosisRickettsial infections (such as African tick-bite fever and Mediterranean spotted fever)Exposure to insects or animals that carry disease-causing organisms, called vectors (in the United States)Ticks: Rickettsiosis, ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, babesiosis, relapsing fever, or tularemiaMosquitoes: Encephalitis caused by arboviruses, malaria, or Zika virus infection; yellow feverWild animals: Tularemia, rabies, or hantavirus infectionFleas: PlagueDomestic animals: Brucellosis, cat-scratch disease, Q fever, or toxoplasmosisBirds: Psittacosis, bird fluReptiles: Salmonella infectionBats: Rabies or histoplasmosisA weakened immune system (immunocompromise)Viruses: Varicella-zoster virus infection or cytomegalovirus infectionBacteria: Infection due to pneumococci, meningococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Nocardia, or mycobacteriaFungi: Infection due to Candida, Aspergillus, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, microsporidia, Pneumocystis jirovecii, or fungi that cause mucormycosisParasites: Infection due to Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Cryptosporidium, or Cystoisospora belliMedications and illicit drugs that can alter body temperatureAmphetaminesPhencyclidine (PCP)Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or Ecstasy)Antipsychotic medications (can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome)Anesthetics (inhaled anesthetic gases such as halothane can cause malignant hyperthermia)ThyroxineInterferons (medications that are based on substances produced by the immune system and that help block the reproduction of viruses)Medications that can trigger fever by a hypersensitivity (allergic) reactionBeta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin)Sulfa drugsPhenytoinCarbamazepineProcainamideQuinidineEvaluation of Fever in AdultsUsually, a doctor can determine that an infection is present based on a brief history, a physical examination, and occasionally a few simple tests, such as a chest x-ray and urine tests. However, sometimes the cause of fever is not readily identified.When doctors initially evaluate people with an acute fever, they focus on 2 general issues:Identifying other symptoms such as headache or cough: These symptoms help narrow the range of possible causes.Determining whether the person is seriously or chronically ill: Many of the possible acute viral infections go away on their own and also are difficult for doctors to diagnose specifically (that is, to determine exactly which virus is causing the infection). Limiting testing to people who are seriously or chronically ill can help avoid many expensive, unnecessary, and often fruitless searches.Warning signsIn people with an acute fever, certain signs and characteristics are cause for concern. They includeA change in mental function, such as confusionA headache, stiff neck, or bothFlat, small, purplish red spots on the skin (petechiae), which indicate bleeding under the skinLow blood pressureRapid heart rate or rapid breathingShortness of breath (dyspnea)A temperature that is higher than 104ï¿½ F (40ï¿½ C) or lower than 95ï¿½ F (35ï¿½ C)Recent travel to an area where a serious infectious disease such as malaria is commonRecent use of medications that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants)When to see a doctorPeople who have any warning signs should see a doctor right away. Such people typically need immediate testing and often admission to a hospital.People without warning signs should call the doctor if the fever lasts more than 24 to 48 hours. Depending on the person's age, other symptoms, and known medical conditions, the doctor may ask the person to come for evaluation or recommend treatment at home. Typically, people should see a doctor if a fever lasts more than 3 or 4 days regardless of other symptoms.What the doctor doesDoctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history. Doctors then do a physical examination. What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the fever and the tests that may need to be done.A doctor begins by asking a person about present and previous symptoms and disorders, medications currently being taken, any blood transfusions, exposure to infections, recent travel, vaccinations, and recent hospitalizations, surgeries, or other medical procedures. The pattern of the fever rarely helps the doctor make a diagnosis. However, a fever that returns every other day or every third day is typical of malaria. Doctors consider malaria and other insect-transmitted infections as a possible cause only if people have traveled to an area where the infection is common.Recent travel may give the doctor clues as to the cause of a fever because some infections occur in certain areas. For example, coccidioidomycosis (a fungal infection) occurs mostly in the southwestern United States.Recent exposures are also important. For example, people who work in a meatpacking plant are more likely to develop brucellosis (a bacterial infection spread through contact with domestic animals). Other examples include unsafe water or food (such as unpasteurized milk and milk products, and raw or undercooked meat, fish, and shellfish), insect (such as mosquitoes) and tick bites, unprotected sex, and occupational or recreational exposures (such as hunting, hiking, and water sports).Pain is an important clue to the possible source of fever, so the doctor asks about any pain in the ears, head, neck, teeth, throat, chest, abdomen, flank, rectum, muscles, and joints.Other symptoms that help determine the cause of the fever include nasal congestion and/or discharge, cough, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency, and pain while urinating). Knowing whether the person has enlarged lymph nodes or a rash (including what it looks like, where it is, and when it appeared in relation to other symptoms) may help the doctor pinpoint a cause. People with recurring fevers, night sweats, and weight loss may have a chronic infection such as tuberculosis or endocarditis (infection of the heart's lining and usually the heart valves).The doctor may also ask about the following:Contact with anyone who has an infectionAny known conditions that predispose to infection, such as HIV infection, diabetes, cancer, organ transplantation, sickle cell disease, use of an artificial pacemaker, or heart valve disorders, particularly if an artificial valve is presentAny known disorders that may cause a fever without infection, such as lupus, gout, sarcoidosis, an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), or cancerUse of any medications that may make a person susceptible to infection, such as cancer chemotherapy, corticosteroids, or other medications that suppress the immune systemUse of illicit drugs that are injectedThe physical examination begins with confirmation of fever. Fever is most accurately determined by measuring rectal temperature, but oral or ear temperature is often measured. Forehead temperature is not as accurate as rectal, but doctors may measure forehead temperature to screen people for fever. Armpit temperature is the least accurate, so doctors rarely use it to confirm a fever. Doctors then do a thorough examination from head to toe to check for a source of infection or evidence of disease.TestingThe need for testing depends on what the doctor finds during the medical history and physical examination.Otherwise healthy people who have an acute fever and only vague, general symptoms (for example, they feel generally ill or achy) probably have a viral illness that will go away without treatment. Therefore, they do not usually require testing. Exceptions are people who are in an area where COVID-19 is being spread, people who have been exposed to an animal or insect that carries and transmits a specific disease (called a vector), such as people with a tick bite, and people who have recently been in an area where a particular disorder (such as malaria) is common.If otherwise healthy people have findings that suggest a particular disorder, testing may be needed. Doctors select tests based on those findings. For example, if people have a headache and stiff neck, a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) is done to look for meningitis. If people have a cough and lung congestion, a chest x-ray is done to look for pneumonia. For certain respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19 or influenza, there are rapid molecular tests that can give results within minutes or a few hours. Some rapid tests can be done at home or in a doctor's office on a sample obtained with a cotton swab. Other rapid tests to identify a specific cause of an infection require a blood sample sent to a laboratory.People who are at increased risk of infection, people who appear seriously ill, and older adults often need testing even when findings do not suggest a particular disorder. For such people, doctors may do the following:A complete blood count (including the number and proportion of different types of white blood cells)Urine and blood culturesA chest x-rayUrinalysisLab TestComplete Blood CountLab TestUrinalysisAn increase in the white blood cell count usually indicates infection. The proportion of different types of white blood cells (differential count) gives further clues. For example, an increase in neutrophils suggests a relatively new bacterial infection. An increase in eosinophils suggests the presence of parasites, such as tapeworms or roundworms. Also, blood, urine, and other body fluids may be sent to the laboratory to try to grow the microorganism in a culture. Other blood tests can be used to detect antibodies against specific microorganisms.Fever of unknown origin (FUO)A fever of unknown origin may be diagnosed when People have a fever of at least 101ï¿½ F (38.3ï¿½ C) for several weeks.Extensive investigation does not detect a cause.In such cases, the cause may be an unusual chronic infection (such as tuberculosis, bacterial infection of the heart, HIV infection, cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus) or something other than an infection, such as a systemic rheumatic disorder (such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis) or cancer (such as lymphoma, ovarian cancer, or leukemia). Other causes include medication or illicit drug reactions, blood clots (deep vein thrombosis), inflammation of organ tissues (sarcoidosis), and inflammatory bowel disease.In older adults, the most common causes of FUO are giant cell arteritis, lymphomas, abscesses, and tuberculosis.Doctors usually do blood tests, including a complete blood count, blood cultures, liver blood tests, and tests to check for systemic rheumatic disorders. Other tests, such as chest x-ray, urinalysis, and urine culture, may be done.Lab TestBacteria Culture TestUltrasound studies, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly of areas that are causing discomfort, may help a doctor diagnose the cause. Radionuclide scanning, done after white blood cells labeled with a radioactive marker are injected into a vein, or positron emission tomography (PET) may be used to identify areas of infection or inflammation.If these test results are negative, doctors may need to take a sample of tissue from the liver, bone marrow, or another site of suspected infection for biopsy. The sample is then examined under a microscope, cultured, and analyzed.The treatment of FUO is focused on treating the disorder causing the fever if it is known. Doctors may give medications to lower the body temperature (see treatment of fever).Treatment of Fever in AdultsThe best fever treatment is treatment of the cause.Because fever helps the body defend against infection and because fever itself is not dangerous (unless it is higher than about 106ï¿½ F [41ï¿½ C]), there is some debate as to whether fever should be routinely treated. However, people with a high fever generally feel much better when the fever is treated. Plus, people with a heart or lung disorder and those with dementia are considered to be at particular risk of dangerous complications, so when they have a fever, it should be treated.Medications used to lower body temperature are called antipyretics.Because many over-the-counter cold or flu preparations contain acetaminophen, people must be careful not to take acetaminophen and one or more of these cold or flu preparations at the same time.Other cooling measures (such as cooling with a tepid water mist and using cooling blankets) are needed only if the temperature is about 106ï¿½ F (41.1ï¿½ C) or higher. People should not apply rubbing alcohol to their skin with a washcloth or sponge because alcohol can be absorbed through the skin and may have harmful effects.People who have a blood infection (bacteremia) or who have abnormal vital signs (such as low blood pressure and a rapid pulse and breathing rate) are admitted to the hospital.Essentials for Older People: FeverFever can be tricky in older people because the body may not respond the way it would in younger people. For example, in frail older adults, infection is less likely to cause fever. Even when elevated by infection, the temperature may be lower than the standard definition of fever, and the degree of fever may not correspond to the severity of the illness. Similarly, other symptoms, such as pain, may be less noticeable. Frequently, a change in mental function or a decline in daily functioning is the only other initial sign of pneumonia or a urinary tract infection.However, older adults with a fever are more likely to have a serious bacterial infection than are younger adults with a fever. As in younger adults, the cause is commonly a respiratory or urinary tract infection. Skin and soft-tissue infections are also common causes of fever in older adults. Older adults are more likely to have serious manifestations of respiratory viral infections such as influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Diagnosis of fever in older adults is similar to that for younger adults, except that for older adults, doctors usually recommend urine tests (including culture) and a chest x-ray. Samples of blood are cultured to rule out a blood infection (bacteremia).Key PointsMost fevers in healthy people are caused by a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection due to a virus.If people with a fever have any warning signs, they should see a doctor right away.Doctors can usually identify an infection based on a brief medical history, a physical examination, and occasionally a few simple tests, and then doctors use these results, particularly symptoms, to determine which other tests are needed.Doctors consider underlying chronic disorders, particularly those that impair the immune system, as a possible cause of fever that lasts a long time.In older adults, infections are less likely to cause fever, and other symptoms may be less noticeable.Test your KnowledgeTake a Quiz!

Updated on October 4, 2018Squeezing sensationNausea, sensitivity to light, soundWaking upFever or stiff neckRapid, severe painHead injuryVision problemsUnusual headachesTriggersTakeaway OverviewHeadaches are extremely common. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly half of adults the world over will have a headache at some point this year.Headaches usually go away without causing further problems. Even many chronic headaches, such as migraines and cluster headaches, arenï¿½t considered signs of more severe, underlying problems. They may need to be treated to improve your life, but they wonï¿½t put your life at risk.Nevertheless, if you experience any unusual symptoms, make immediate arrangements to visit a doctor or the emergency room (ER). Headache that feels like head squeezingThe tension-type headache is the most common primary headache. Itï¿½s usually bilateral, which means that it affects both sides of the head. Itï¿½s commonly described as a squeezing sensation.Tension-type headaches can be stress- or musculoskeletal-related. They can be treated with over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and aspirin (Bayer). Headache accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light and soundThese are common symptoms of migraine headaches. Migraines cause a throbbing sensation that usually occurs on just one side of the head.Theyï¿½re one of the top 10 causes of disability worldwide. They arenï¿½t life-threatening, but they can severely impact your well-being.If youï¿½re experiencing migraines, itï¿½s important for you to find out if thereï¿½s a cause. Migraines are most common in people 30 to 40 years old, according to The Migraine Trust. According to the Office on Womenï¿½s Health, around 75 percent of people affected by migraines are women.Factors that can make a person more likely to experience chronic migraines include:obesitydiabetesdepressionhypertensionstressful life eventsA variety of prescription drugs are available to treat migraines. Other treatments include OTC painkillers such as Excedrin Migraine and alternative methods such as acupuncture and herbal remedies. Headache that wakes you upBeing woken by head pain is a common symptom of cluster headaches. These are also known as alarm clock headaches. Like migraines, cluster headaches occur most often on just one side of the head.Cluster headaches happen in patterns called cluster periods, during which time the pain can be quite intense and prevent you from sleeping. Sometimes cluster headache pain is centered around one or both of the eyes.Cluster headaches are generally not life-threatening. However, they can be debilitating, so youï¿½ll want to find out the underlying cause.Headaches that wake you from your sleep can also be caused by medical conditions such as high blood pressure, sleep apnea, and brain tumors. Depression and caffeine withdrawal can also cause cluster headaches.Cluster headaches are most likely to affect people between 20 to 50 years old and men, according to the Mayo Clinic.Home remedies that may bring relief include magnesium supplements, melatonin, and capsaicin cream. Other treatment methods include supplemental oxygen, triptan medications, and the intravenous medication dihydroergotamine (DHE). Headache with a fever or stiff neckA headache combined with a fever or a stiff neck may indicate encephalitis or meningitis. Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain, while meningitis is inflammation of the membrane that surrounds the brain.When due to severe infection, either condition can be fatal. A compromised immune system, diabetes mellitus, and use of immune-system suppressing medication can make you more susceptible to these infections.These infections must be treated immediately with intravenous antibiotic therapy. Thunderclap headacheA thunderclap headache is an extremely severe headache that comes on rapidly. Itï¿½s sometimes called a lone acute headache. It develops in 60 seconds or less and causes intense pain.Thunderclap headaches can be caused by bleeding in the brain after an arterial aneurysm rupture, stroke, or other injury.Pain from thunderclap headaches might occur anywhere on your head and extend to your neck or even areas of your lower back. The intense pain can last for an hour or more, and might be accompanied by dizziness, nausea, or loss of consciousness.Meningitis, encephalitis, and brain tumors can cause thunderclap headaches. Hypertension is a more common cause.The treatment for this kind of headache will depend on the cause. Itï¿½s important to speak to a doctor immediately if you have a headache that reaches peak intensity in a minute or less and doesnï¿½t subside. Headache after a head injuryAny head trauma that causes a headache requires prompt medical attention. A headache after any kind of impact to the head can indicate a concussion.Concussion is a particular risk if the headache continues to worsen after the injury. Even a minor fall or bump to the head can result in potentially life-threatening bleeding in the brain. Headache accompanied by vision problemsAn ocular migraine can temporarily cause blindness or flashing lights in one eye. These symptoms will sometimes accompany a typical migraine headache as well.If your migraines or regular headaches are accompanied by these visual disturbances, you need to tell your doctor. Itï¿½s possible that spasms in the retina cause these symptoms. People who experience ocular migraines may be more prone to long-term vision loss.Migraines with auras, formerly known as classic migraines, can also cause ï¿½floatingï¿½ lights or blind spots. In that case, however, the symptoms will occur in both eyes. New or unusual headachesBesides the specific headache symptoms described above, any new or unusual headaches should be discussed with your doctor. Pay particular attention to headaches that:first develop after age 50suddenly change in frequency, location, or severityget consistently worse over timeare accompanied by changes in personalitycause weaknessaffect your vision or speechWomen who are experiencing menopause might find that they have new headache patterns or experience migraines when they never have before.COPING WITH HEADACHESHeadaches are very common, but certain characteristics can signal a serious condition. For more common headaches, such as tension, cluster, or even migraine headaches, there are triggers, which can vary from person to person. Paying attention to your triggers and making small adjustments to your lifestyle may help avoid headache attacks. ï¿½ Seunggu Han, MD Headache triggersSometimes a headache can indicate that your body is experiencing withdrawal from a chemical substance (such as caffeine). Other times your headache might be triggered by the dehydrating effects of alcohol consumption.Itï¿½s also not unusual for people to experience headaches when they quit smoking tobacco products, due to nicotine withdrawal. These headache triggers are usually not indicative of any greater medical problem, and lifestyle choices can ensure that these headaches wonï¿½t continue.Fatigue headaches, sometimes called exertional headaches, can be caused when your body is strained by too much physical activity. Eye muscle strain and lack of sleep can cause a dull throbbing headache that feels similar to an exertional headache.Making sure to get enough rest, taking frequent breaks from computer work, and drinking the recommended amount of water each day will probably stop these headaches from happening.KEEP A JOURNALKeeping a journal with details of what you were doing or what was happening at the time of your headaches may help to pinpoint things that you may want to avoid in the future to prevent a similar headache from recurring. ï¿½ Stacy R. Sampson, DO TakeawayTreatments for headaches will vary widely, depending on their cause. Most headaches can be treated at home with ibuprofen or aspirin to relieve mild pain.But if youï¿½re experiencing any of the warning signs listed above, youï¿½ll need to seek a doctorï¿½s counsel for how to best treat your symptoms.Antidepressant medication, blood pressure medication, lifestyle changes, and other treatment regimens may be recommended to aid you in getting headache relief.How we reviewed this article:SourcesHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

When to Seek Care
The combination of a fever and a headache is a common sign of infection. Some infections that cause fever and headache, such as bacterial meningitis, can be serious and require hospitalization. Other infections that cause fever and headache are more run-of-the-mill and will get better on their own. Sometimes, fever and headache can be a sign of a chronic, non-infectious illness, like lupus or heatstroke.
The article discusses both infectious and non-infectious causes of a headache with a fever. It also covers other possible symptoms and when you should see a healthcare provider.
Verywell / Joshua Seong
Meningitis
Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the protective membranes around the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis is usually caused by viruses or bacteria, but it can also be caused by some medicines or non-infectious illnesses.
While any type of meningitis can be serious, viral meningitis tends to be less severe than bacterial meningitis.
Symptoms
In addition to a severe, generalized headache and a high fever, symptoms of meningitis may include:
Neck stiffnessNauseaVomitingConfusionRashSensitivity to lightJoint painsSeizures
A person who has meningitis typically will not have all of these symptoms. If you think you may have symptoms of meningitis, seek immediate medical care.
In the majority of people with meningitis, nuchal rigidity will be present. This means that a person canï¿½t easily flex their neck, and they may be unable to touch their chin to their chest.
Treatment
With viral meningitis, there is no specific treatment. Most people recover on their own from viral meningitis after a week to 10 days. An antiviral medication could help if the meningitis is caused by certain viruses such as influenza or herpes virus.
Bacterial meningitis is treated with antibiotics. Because bacterial meningitis can be a serious, life-threatening infection, itï¿½s important to start treatment as soon as possible.
Encephalitis
Encephalitis is an infection of the central nervous system that may be caused by a virus, bacteria, or fungus.
The key difference between meningitis and encephalitis is that meningitis is inflammation of the lining around the brain and encephalitis is inflammation of the brain itself. Both meningitis and encephalitis can cause abnormalities in brain function leading to confusion and seizures.
Encephalitis is a serious, life-threatening disease that needs immediate medical attention. Severe cases lead to death in about 10% of patients.
Because the two can be so difficult to differentiate, doctors sometimes use the term ï¿½meningoencephalitis.ï¿½
Symptoms
In addition to fever and headache, symptoms of encephalitis include:
Joint painMuscle weaknessStiff neckNausea
Encephalitis causes symptoms with brain function as well, including:
ConfusionBehavior changesSensitivity to lightDifficulty speakingTrouble movingMemory issuesLoss of consciousnessSeizures
Treatment
Treatment depends on the type of encephalitis you have. If itï¿½s a bacterial infection, antibiotics should be prescribed. For viral infections, antiviral medications may be given.Other treatments may depend on the severity and effects of the illness. Steroids may be given to reduce swelling and brain pressure.
Cold or Flu
Influenza, commonly known as ï¿½the flu,ï¿½ mononucleosis "mono," and the common cold can cause fever and headache. These illnesses are caused by viruses that spread easily from person to person.
Mono is usually mild, and the flu can cause mild symptoms or severe illness. In some instances, it can be serious enough to be life-threatening, especially for those over 65, people with chronic illnesses, and newborns.
Symptoms
Along with fever and headache, other symptoms of the flu or mono may include:
Chills
Cough
Stuffy or runny nose
Muscle aches
Fatigue (tiredness)
Vomiting or diarrhea are possible (more common in children)
When you have a cold, the symptoms can be similar to the flu. Fever and headache are possible but less common with a cold than with the flu.
Symptoms of a cold include:
SneezingRunny or stuffy noseSore throatCough
Treatment
Often, the best treatment for a cold, the flu, or mono is to stay home, get lots of rest, and drink lots of fluids. Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen may also help with a headache and fever.
If you have the flu, your doctor may be able to prescribe antiviral drugs. These can reduce the amount of time youï¿½re sick by a couple of days and decrease the chance of complications.
Physicians donï¿½t prescribe antibiotics for a cold, the flu, or mono since theyï¿½re not effective against viruses. However, if you get a complication from the cold or flu, such as a bacterial sinus infection, you might need an antibiotic.
Brain Abscess
A brain abscess is a rare, but potentially life-threatening condition, in which infected fluid collects in the brain.
A headache from a brain abscess occurs as a result of elevated intracranial pressure as the abscess continues to grow and take up space.
Symptoms
Symptoms of a brain abscess can resemble that of meningitis or encephalitis. In addition to fever and headache, symptoms include:
Neck stiffnessChillsVomitingConfusion, trouble focusing, or sleepinessWeaknessLanguage problemsLoss of muscle function, usually on one sideVision changesSeizures
Treatment
Medication may be the first step if the abscess is less than 2 centimeters or the abscess is deep in the brain. This can include antibiotics or antifungal medication, depending on what caused the infection. Diuretics, which reduce fluid, may also be used to decrease swelling in the brain.
Surgery may be needed to drain the abscess if itï¿½s larger than 2 centimeters or if it might rupture. If the abscess is deep, needle aspiration guided by a CT or MRI scan may be used to drain the fluid.
Sinus Infection
A sinus infection, or sinusitis, is the swelling or inflammation of the lining in your sinuses. Your sinuses are hollow spaces behind your forehead, eyes, and cheeks that connect to your nasal passages.
The sinuses make thin mucus that drains out of the nose. When they become blocked with fluid, bacteria can grow and cause an infection. This extra mucus could be caused by a cold or allergies.
Symptoms
A bacterial sinus infection can give you a fever and a sinus headache, which you may feel around your eyes and forehead.
Other symptoms include:
Facial tenderness or swellingEar painTooth painThick nasal discharge
Treatment
If you have bacterial sinusitis, a week or so of antibiotics, rest, fluids, and steam should clear it up quickly. Very rarely sinus infections lead to other complications like a brain abscess, meningitis, blood clot, or osteomyelitisï¿½anï¿½infection of the facial bones (especially the forehead).
If you are diagnosed with a sinus infection, be sure to follow up with your healthcare provider if your fever persists while taking antibiotics.
Heatstroke
Heatstroke is the most severe form of heat-related illness. It happens when your body overheats to over 106ï¿½F and you arenï¿½t able to sweat enough to cool your body down. It can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention.
Symptoms
The symptoms of heatstroke include:
High body temperature (over 106ï¿½F)Confusion or altered mental statusLoss of consciousness (coma)Slurred speechHot, dry skin or excessive sweatingSeizuresDeath, unless treated promptly
Treatment
Heatstroke is a medical emergency. Call 911 if you suspect heatstroke.
While waiting for medical help, try cooling the personï¿½s body as quickly as possible. Get to a shady, cool area. Have them lie down and elevate their feet. Apply cold water to the skin and then use a fan to help cool the body quickly.
In the emergency room, intravenous (IV) fluids will be used to replace fluids lost.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) causes pain, stiffness, andï¿½swelling in the joints. Itï¿½s an autoimmune disease, which means that it happens when the immune system attacks the bodyï¿½s own healthy tissues. In some cases, it can cause fever and headaches.
Symptoms
RA can occasionally cause mild fevers. It can also cause headaches, particularly if it affects the cervical spine.
Other symptoms include:

Treatment
Treatment for RA typically includes disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These can slow the progression of RA by modifying your immune system. Biologic agents are sometimes used to control inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis.
HIV or AIDS
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) damages your immune system by attacking a type of white blood cell that fights infections.
If HIV isnï¿½t treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection in which the immune system is severely damaged.
Early HIV or AIDS can cause many different symptoms. Headache and fever are possible symptoms of both.
Symptoms
Symptoms of early HIV infection can happen two to four weeks after exposure to the virus. These early symptoms are estimated to affect about two-thirds of those infected.
Early HIV symptoms include:
Fever (above 100.4 degrees F)HeadacheSore throatMuscle and joint painRash that occurs two to three days after fever
If HIV isnï¿½t treated, it weakens your immune system and can lead to AIDS. At this stage, youï¿½re more likely to develop ï¿½opportunistic infections,ï¿½ severe illnesses that your body canï¿½t fight off. Depending on the infection, symptoms can include fevers, shortness of breath, blurred vision, and weight loss.
Treatment
While there isnï¿½t a cure for HIV, medications are available to control it. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) involves taking a daily combination of HIV medications. This reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and helps protect the immune system.
Lupus
Lupus is an autoimmune disease. It can cause swelling and pain throughout your body. Your symptoms can be minimal at times and flare up at other times, suddenly becoming more severe.
Symptoms
Headaches are a common symptom for people with lupus. In a 2021 study, 54% of patients with lupus reported having primary headaches, with migraines being the most common.
Reoccuring low-grade fevers are also common before a lupus flare or oncoming illness.
Other symptoms include:
Joint stiffness, pain, or swellingFatigueSwelling in the hands or feetSensitivity to lightChest pain when taking deep breathsHair lossSores in the mouth or noseButterfly-shaped rash on cheeks and nose
Treatment
There is no cure for lupus, but different types of medications are available to treat symptoms and manage the illness. Some medications can help treat swelling and pain. Others help prevent the immune system from attacking tissues in the body.
For mild pain and fevers, your physician may suggest over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen.
Corticosteroids such as prednisone can help reduce pain and calm the immune system. They may be prescribed in either low or high doses, depending on the severity of the illness.
Antimalarial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate may also be prescribed. In addition to treating malaria, they help treat joint pain, fatigue, and lung inflammation with lupus.
Other Causes
There are also less common causes of the combination of fever and headache. Some of them are rare, and some may cause a headache or fever, but do not usually cause that combination.
Your healthcare provider might consider these causes if your symptoms are unusual or if the initial testing and treatments for more common causes don't provide answers or relief.
Conditions may include:
Giant cell arteritis: Also called temporal arteritis, this is an inflammatory condition of the arteries that run under the scalp. It can cause pain, vision changes, and a fever.
Sarcoidosis: This inflammatory condition is not common. Neurosarcoidosis can cause inflammation in or near the brain, potentially causing neurological symptoms, and it may cause a headache. A fever is not a common sign of sarcoidosis.
Pituitary apoplexy: This is a rare condition that occurs when the blood supply to the pituitary gland is blocked or when there is bleeding of this gland. It can cause a headache, nausea, vomiting, vision changes, fever, and loss of consciousness.
Brain tumor: A primary brain tumor that starts in the brain or a metastatic brain tumor that spreads to the brain from somewhere else In the body can cause a headache and neurological symptoms (such as vision changes or weakness). This doesn't usually cause a fever.
Osteomyelitis: Inflammation or an infection of bone may affect the skull or upper spine, causing a headache with a fever. This is not a common condition.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage: A blood vessel rupture can cause a severe headache, often with changes in consciousness. A fever is not a typical symptom of this life-threatening condition.
When to See a Healthcare Provider
If you have a fever and headache, you may need to get medical care to determine the cause. Call your doctor to let them know your symptoms.
Go to the doctor right away if you experience any of the following:
A severe headacheA headache that doesnï¿½t go away with medicationFever and/or headache that are persistentHeadache and fever that get worse instead of improvingHeadaches and fever that happen more often than usual
Seek immediate medical care if you have fever and headache in addition to these symptoms:
Stiff or painful neckRashVomitingConfusionFaintingChanges in consciousnessVision changesLoss of muscle functionDifficulty speaking or movingSeizures
You should also go to the emergency room for extremely painful headaches that occur suddenly. These are called thunderclap headaches because they can appear suddenly like a crash of thunder.
Some thunderclap headaches can occur because of a problem with blood vessels in the brain. This can include a stroke or a brain aneurysm.
A thunderclap headache can represent a serious, life-threatening medical condition, so get help right away by either calling 911 or going to your nearest emergency room.
Summary
Having both a fever and headache can be signs of an infectious or non-infectious condition. Some illnesses may be mild, such as the common cold. Others can be serious, or even life-threatening, such as meningitis or a brain abscess.
Call your doctor if you have any questions about what could be causing your headache and fever. Let them know if you have new or concerning symptoms, or if theyï¿½re persistent or getting worse. Seek emergency care for any severe symptoms.

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm ï¿½ or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs) ï¿½ also known as your body's "thermostat" ï¿½ monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis ï¿½ inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children.

A fever is one of the bodyï¿½s natural responses to foreign invaders. The body may keep its core temperature elevated while it is fighting off the infection.Other sources of infections that may cause a low grade fever include:food poisoningexposure to pathogens from livestocktuberculosismeningitisAnyone experiencing symptoms of infection alongside a fever should see a doctor if the symptoms do not improve with rest and time.MedicationsSome medications can cause many different side effects, which may include a low grade fever. People can check the information on side effects and interactions that comes in the packaging or seek advice from a pharmacist.As the author of a 2018 review notes, if the medication is the cause, the fever should go away very quickly ï¿½ typically within 72 hours ï¿½ once the person stops taking the drug.StressChronic stress may cause a low grade fever. A research paper from 2015 notes that a fever due to stress is most common in young women.Reducing stress levels may resolve the fever in these cases.CancerIn rare cases, a persistent low grade fever with no known cause may be a sign of cancer.A persistent fever can be a symptom of leukemia, Hodgkin disease, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.The person may also experience other symptoms of cancer, including:persistent fatigueweaknessheadachesinfectionslack of appetiteexcessive bruising or bleedingunexplained weight lossenlarged lymph nodesexcessive sweating at nightMany of these symptoms are not unique to cancer, however.Anyone who experiences these symptoms along with a low grade fever should see a doctor for a diagnosis.Chronic disordersMany other chronic disorders may cause symptoms such as a low grade fever, including:thromboembolic diseasearthritislupusgoutthyroiditisserum sickness-like reactionsserotonin syndromeneuroleptic malignant syndromeDiagnosisDiagnosing a persistent low grade fever may involve several different tests to eliminate potential causes.The doctor will generally carry out a physical examination and question the person regarding additional symptoms and whether they have any chronic conditions.The doctor may also ask about any medications that the person takes so that they can eliminate them as a cause of the fever.They may order blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC), to get an overview of the personï¿½s health. The results may help them decide which other tests, if any, they need to order.If the doctor suspects that the person has a UTI, they may ask them for a sample of their urine to test.TreatmentsShare on PinterestOTC drugs may help treat a low grade fever at home.Treatment for a persistent low grade fever will depend on the cause. For instance, minor infections may not need treatment at all, whereas issues such as cancer require extensive treatment.To alleviate the symptoms of a low grade fever at home, a person can try over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).A fever can cause dehydration, so it is vital to drink plenty of water.It is important to treat a low grade fever in children, who may be more sensitive to temperature changes. Using childrenï¿½s versions of OTC drugs may help control the fever while waiting to see a doctor.OutlookA persistent low grade fever is a sign of an underlying issue, such as a mild infection or chronic condition. The fever may persist while the person is fighting off the infection.For the most part, persistent low grade fevers are not a cause for concern. However, it is important to monitor the fever to see whether it gets worse.Anyone who is concerned about their symptoms or experiences a persistent low grade fever for more than 10 days should see a doctor.SHOP FOR OTC DRUGSThe drugs listed in this article are available online:IbuprofenAcetaminophenFlu / Cold / SARSImmune System / VaccinesInfectious Diseases / Bacteria / VirusesHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

Itï¿½s common in both children and adults and usually goes away on its own within a few days. If it doesnï¿½t improve or if youï¿½re experiencing other symptoms like a fever or bloody stool, reach out to a provider to get the treatment (and relief) you need.ContentsArrow DownOverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionLiving WithContentsArrow DownOverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionLiving WithOverviewGerms, diseases affecting your gut and even treatments can all cause diarrhea.What is diarrhea?Diarrhea means having a loose or watery stool (poop). Itï¿½s so common that most people flinch when they hear the word. The thought of thin, sickly-looking poop in the toilet bowl never stops feeling unpleasant. If you have diarrhea, not knowing whatï¿½s causing it or how long itï¿½ll last only adds stress to the unpleasant feelings.The good news is that diarrhea is usually mild (only a few bathroom trips a day) and goes away within a few days.Sometimes, though, diarrhea is a sign of a serious condition. It can cause you to lose too much fluid (dehydration) or prevent you from getting enough nutrients. Itï¿½s important to know what to look out for so you know when to see a healthcare provider about diarrhea and when to wait it out.Types of diarrheaDiarrhea goes by different names depending on how long it lasts:Acute diarrhea: Acute diarrhea is loose, watery diarrhea that lasts one to two days. Itï¿½s the most common type and usually goes away without treatment.Persistent diarrhea: Persistent diarrhea lasts about two to four weeks.Chronic diarrhea: Chronic diarrhea lasts more than four weeks or comes and goes regularly over a long period. Diarrhea that lasts this long may indicate a more serious condition that warrants a visit with your healthcare provider.How common is diarrhea?Itï¿½s incredibly common and affects people of all ages. Most adults get acute diarrhea once a year, while children tend to get it twice a year.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicySymptoms and CausesWhat causes diarrhea?The main cause of diarrhea is a virus that infects your gut (gastroenteritis). Some call it the ï¿½stomach fluï¿½ or a ï¿½stomach bug.ï¿½ But diarrhea can have lots of causes.Infections. Pathogens (viruses, bacteria and parasites) can all cause infections that lead to diarrhea. The most common cause of diarrhea in adults is the norovirus that causes gastroenteritis. Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children.Food poisoning. You can ingest harmful toxins and pathogens from contaminated foods or drinks. Once theyï¿½re in your gut, the toxins or germs can cause diarrhea. ï¿½Travelerï¿½s diarrheaï¿½ is when you get diarrhea while traveling in a new environment with poor hygiene or sanitation. Usually, itï¿½s exposure to bacteria that gives you diarrhea.Medications. Diarrhea is a common medication side effect. For example, antibiotics kill harmful bacteria that make you sick, but they can destroy helpful bacteria in the process. Not having enough good bacteria can lead to diarrhea. Diarrhea is also a side effect of antacids with magnesium and some cancer drugs and treatments. Overusing laxatives can also cause diarrhea.Foods that upset your digestive system. If youï¿½re lactose intolerant, you get diarrhea because your body struggles to digest lactose, the sugar in dairy. Some people have trouble digesting fructose, a sugar in honey and fruits thatï¿½s added as a sweetener to some foods. With celiac disease, you get diarrhea because your body has trouble breaking down gluten, a protein in wheat.Diseases affecting your bowels. Diarrhea is a common symptom of conditions that cause irritation and inflammation in your bowels (intestines). Crohnï¿½s disease, ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can all cause diarrhea. Stress and anxiety can worsen symptoms if you have a condition like IBS.Procedures on your bowels. Many people have diarrhea after surgery on their bowels. It may take a while for your digestive tract to absorb nutrients from the foods youï¿½re eating and create firm stools from the waste.What are the symptoms of diarrhea?The main sign of diarrhea is loose or watery stool. Other common symptoms include:Bloating or cramps in your belly.A strong and urgent need to poop.Nausea (upset stomach).These symptoms usually donï¿½t require a provider visit, especially if they only last a few days.Signs and symptoms of severe diarrheaSevere cases of diarrhea may signal a medical condition, like a serious infection, that wonï¿½t get better without treatment from a healthcare provider.Contact your provider if you have diarrhea with:Fever.Severe pain.Vomiting.Blood or mucus in your stool.Weight loss (this can be a sign that your bodyï¿½s not absorbing enough nutrients).Contact a provider if youï¿½re experiencing symptoms of dehydration or noticing signs of dehydration in your child, including:Headache.Flushed, dry skin.Irritability and confusion.Severe nausea and vomiting.Light-headedness and dizziness.Fatigue (tiredness that doesnï¿½t improve with rest).Dark pee, small amounts of pee or no peeing at all.Fewer than six wet diapers a day (infants).No wet diapers or peeing for eight hours (toddlers).No tears when crying (infants and toddlers).AdvertisementWhat are the complications of diarrhea?Dehydration is one of the biggest concerns with diarrhea. This is especially true among vulnerable populations (infants, people 65 and older and people with compromised immune systems). Without treatment, dehydration can lead to kidney failure, stroke, heart attack or even death.Diagnosis and TestsHow is diarrhea diagnosed?Most cases of diarrhea donï¿½t require a diagnosis or treatment. In more severe cases, your provider will work to determine the cause. Theyï¿½ll ask about your medical history, family medical history, travel history and any sick contacts you may have.They may order tests, including:Blood tests to rule out certain conditions that cause diarrhea.A stool test to check for blood, bacterial infections and parasites.A hydrogen breath test to check for lactose or fructose intolerance and bacterial overgrowth.An endoscopy of your upper and lower digestive tract to rule out growths or other structural issues that can cause diarrhea, like ulcers or tumors.AdvertisementManagement and TreatmentHow is diarrhea treated?Usually, you can get rid of diarrhea at home. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines for diarrhea, like bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismolï¿½ or Kaopectateï¿½), often help people feel better quickly. Youï¿½ll need to see a healthcare provider for diarrhea that doesnï¿½t improve or that happens alongside symptoms of severe diarrhea.Your provider may recommend treatments like:Antibiotics or antiparasitics. These drugs kill infection-causing germs.Medications that treat chronic conditions. Treating underlying conditions that cause diarrhea, like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and IBS, can help.Probiotics. Probiotics introduce good bacteria into your gut to combat diarrhea. Your healthcare provider may suggest you try them. Always talk to your provider before starting a probiotic or any supplement.Can I stop diarrhea without taking anti-diarrhea medicine?You can often get rid of acute diarrhea through lifestyle changes you can make at home.Drink plenty of water and other electrolyte-balanced fluids. These include diluted and pulp-free fruit juices, broths, sports drinks (Gatoradeï¿½) and caffeine-free sodas. These drinks replace lost water and electrolytes youï¿½re losing with diarrhea. Electrolytes are substances that help with important processes, like maintaining the balance of fluids in your body.Choose foods that can firm your stools. Certain low-fiber foods make stools more solid. Try the BRAT diet: (B)ananas, white (R)ice, (A)pplesauce and (T)oast. Potatoes, noodles, lean beef, fish and chicken or turkey without the skin are also good options. Changing your diet can make a huge difference when it comes to getting relief.Avoid caffeine and alcohol. Caffeinated foods and drinks can have a mild laxative effect that worsens diarrhea. Steer clear of coffee, sodas, strong tea/green tea and chocolate. Avoid alcohol, which can lead to dehydration.Avoid foods and drinks that give you gas. Avoid beans, cabbage, brussels sprouts, beer and carbonated beverages to prevent stomach cramps. Sometimes, diarrhea can make you temporarily lactose intolerant. Avoiding dairy until your diarrhea clears is a good idea.How can I relieve discomfort caused by diarrhea?Diarrhea can cause your anus (butthole) to feel sore, itchy or like itï¿½s burning. It may hurt to poop. You can ease the pain by sitting in lukewarm water in the bathtub or trying a sitz bath. Pat your anus dry instead of rubbing it when you get out of the water. Applying petroleum jelly or a hemorrhoid cream to your anus can keep it from getting too raw.What do I do if my baby or young child has diarrhea?Call your childï¿½s pediatrician if they have severe diarrhea. Treatments for diarrhea in children are different from treatments for adults. Over-the-counter medications may be dangerous.Children are also at a higher risk of dehydration than adults. Your provider will help you determine the best way to keep them hydrated, but options include:Breast (chest) milk.Formula.Electrolyte drinks (Pedialyteï¿½) for older children. (Providers donï¿½t recommend this for babies.)The best option to keep your child hydrated might change as the child gets older. Always check with a provider before giving your child a new liquid or treatment of any kind.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentPreventionCan diarrhea be prevented?\u200b\u200bYou canï¿½t always prevent diarrhea, but you can reduce your risk of getting it because of infections or food contamination.Practice good hygiene: Wash your hands with soap and water after using the bathroom or preparing and eating food. Another option is to use hand sanitizer.Get vaccinated: The rotavirus vaccine prevents rotavirus, a common cause of diarrhea. The vaccine for COVID-19 can reduce your risk of getting COVID and experiencing COVID symptoms, including diarrhea.Store food properly: Store food at the correct temperatures, and cook all foods until they reach the recommended temperatures. Donï¿½t take chances by consuming foods or drinks past their expiration dates.Watch what you drink when you travel: Donï¿½t drink untreated water when you travel. Avoid tap water, ice cubes or brushing your teeth with tap water. Steer clear of unpasteurized milk or juice products. Pasteurization is a process that kills germs in certain drinks. When in doubt, drink bottled water or something thatï¿½s been boiled first (coffee or tea).Watch what you eat when you travel. Avoid raw or undercooked meats (and shellfish), as well as raw fruits and vegetables. Fruits and veggies are usually healthy options, but the skin may contain contaminants that can make you sick.Living WithWhen should I call my doctor about diarrhea?Call your healthcare provider if you have diarrhea that doesnï¿½t improve or go away within a few days. Reach out if you have a fever, severe pain and a bloody stool in addition to diarrhea.See a healthcare provider if youï¿½re experiencing symptoms of dehydration, which can be serious without treatment.A note from Cleveland ClinicGoing to the bathroom, having a bowel movement, pooping ï¿½ no matter what you call it, stool is a regular part of life. Thatï¿½s a big reason why diarrhea is so uncomfortable. It messes up our normal. Usually, diarrhea is a short-term thing that resolves in a few days. If it doesnï¿½t, or if youï¿½re experiencing symptoms of severe diarrhea, contact your healthcare provider. And donï¿½t be embarrassed. Diarrhea is a common condition your provider knows all about. They can advise you on the best ways to get relief fast.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 09/20/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Article Sections
Acute diarrhea in adults is a common problem encountered by family physicians. The most common etiology is viral gastroenteritis, a self-limited disease. Increases in travel, comorbidities, and foodborne illness lead to more bacteria-related cases of acute diarrhea. A history and physical examination evaluating for risk factors and signs of inflammatory diarrhea and/or severe dehydration can direct any needed testing and treatment. Most patients do not require laboratory workup, and routine stool cultures are not recommended. Treatment focuses on preventing and treating dehydration. Diagnostic investigation should be reserved for patients with severe dehydration or illness, persistent fever, bloody stool, or immunosuppression, and for cases of suspected nosocomial infection or outbreak. Oral rehydration therapy with early refeeding is the preferred treatment for dehydration. Antimotility agents should be avoided in patients with bloody diarrhea, but loperamide/simethicone may improve symptoms in patients with watery diarrhea. Probiotic use may shorten the duration of illness. When used appropriately, antibiotics are effective in the treatment of shigellosis, campylobacteriosis, Clostridium difficile, traveler's diarrhea, and protozoal infections. Prevention of acute diarrhea is promoted through adequate hand washing, safe food preparation, access to clean water, and vaccinations.
Acute diarrhea is defined as stool with increased water content, volume, or frequency that lasts less than 14 days.1 Diarrheal illness accounts for 2.5 million deaths per year worldwide.2 In the United States, an estimated 48 million foodborne diarrheal illnesses occur annually, resulting in more than 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths.3,4 In the developing world, infectious causes of acute diarrhea are largely related to contaminated food and water supplies.5 In the developed world, technological progress and an increase in mass production of food have paradoxically contributed to the persistence of foodborne illness, despite higher standards of food production.6
Clinical recommendationEvidence ratingReferencesIn patients with acute diarrhea, stool cultures should be reserved for grossly bloody stool, severe dehydration, signs of inflammatory disease, symptoms lasting more than three to seven days, immunosuppression, and suspected nosocomial infections.C25, 26 Testing for Clostridium difficile toxins A and B should be performed in patients who develop unexplained diarrhea after three days of hospitalization.C25, 27 Routine testing for ova and parasites in acute diarrhea is not necessary in developed countries, unless the patient is in a high-risk group (i.e., diarrhea lasting more than seven days, especially if associated with infants in day care or travel to mountainous regions; diarrhea in patients with AIDS or men who have sex with men; community waterborne outbreaks; or bloody diarrhea with few fecal leukocytes).C11, 29 The first step to treating acute diarrhea is rehydration, preferably oral rehydration.C1 Combination loperamide/simethicone may provide faster and more complete relief of acute nonspecific diarrhea and gas-related discomfort than either medication alone.B39 Antibiotics (usually a quinolone) reduce the duration and severity of traveler's diarrhea.A42
Differential Diagnosis
Infectious causes of acute diarrhea include viruses, bacteria, and, less often, parasites. Noninfectious causes include medication adverse effects, acute abdominal processes, gastroenterologic disease, and endocrine disease.
Clinically, acute infectious diarrhea is classified into two pathophysiologic syndromes, commonly referred to as noninflammatory (mostly viral, milder disease) and inflammatory (mostly invasive or with toxin-producing bacteria, more severe disease).7,8 Table 1 compares noninflammatory and inflammatory acute infectious diarrhea.7,8

Viral infections are the most common cause of acute diarrhea.9 Bacterial infections are more often associated with travel, comorbidities, and foodborne illness. When a specific organism is identified, the most common causes of acute diarrhea in the United States are Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, and Shiga toxinï¿½producing Escherichia coli (enterohemorrhagic E. coli).10 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a comprehensive list of foodborne illnesses at http://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/diseases.
History and Physical Examination
HISTORY
The onset, duration, severity, and frequency of diarrhea should be noted, with particular attention to stool character (e.g., watery, bloody, mucus-filled, purulent, bilious). The patient should be evaluated for signs of dehydration, including decreased urine output, thirst, dizziness, and change in mental status. Vomiting is more suggestive of viral illness or illness caused by ingestion of a preformed bacterial toxin. Symptoms more suggestive of invasive bacterial (inflammatory) diarrhea include fever, tenesmus, and grossly bloody stool.11
A food and travel history is helpful to evaluate potential exposures. Children in day care, nursing home residents, food handlers, and recently hospitalized patients are at high risk of infectious diarrheal illness. Pregnant women have a 12-fold increased risk of listeriosis,12 which is primarily contracted by consuming cold meats, soft cheeses, and raw milk.13 Recent sick contacts and use of antibiotics and other medications should be noted in patients with acute diarrhea. Sexual practices that include receptive anal and oral-anal contact increase the possibility of direct rectal inoculation and fecal-oral transmission.
The history should also include gastroenterologic disease or surgery; endocrine disease; radiation to the pelvis; and factors that increase the risk of immunosuppression, including human immunodeficiency virus infection, long-term steroid use, chemotherapy, and immunoglobulin A deficiency. History findings associated with causes of diarrhea are summarized in Table 2,1,7,8,14,15 and clinical features by pathogen are summarized in Table 3.1,14

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
The primary goal of the physical examination is to assess the patient's degree of dehydration. Generally ill appearance, dry mucous membranes, delayed capillary refill time, increased heart rate, and abnormal orthostatic vital signs can be helpful in identifying more severe dehydration. Fever is more suggestive of inflammatory diarrhea. The abdominal examination is important to assess for pain and acute abdominal processes. A rectal examination may be helpful in assessing for blood, rectal tenderness, and stool consistency.
Diagnostic Testing
Because most watery diarrhea is self-limited, testing is usually not indicated.1,16 In general, specific diagnostic investigation can be reserved for patients with severe dehydration, more severe illness, persistent fever, bloody stool, or immunosuppression, and for cases of suspected nosocomial infection or outbreak.
OCCULT BLOOD
It is unclear how much fecal occult blood testing affects pretest probability. Nevertheless, it is a rapid and inexpensive test, and when tests are positive for fecal occult blood in conjunction with the presence of fecal leukocytes or lactoferrin, the diagnosis of inflammatory diarrhea is more common.17 Of note, fecal occult blood testing is 71% sensitive and 79% specific for inflammatory diarrhea in developed countries, but the sensitivity drops to 44% and specificity to 72% in developing countries.18
LEUKOCYTES AND LACTOFERRIN
Testing stool for leukocytes to screen for inflammatory diarrhea poses several challenges, including the handling of specimens and the standardization of laboratory processing and interpretation. There is a wide variability in sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, this testing has fallen out of favor.18
Lactoferrin is a marker for leukocytes that is released by damaged or deteriorating cells, and increases in the setting of bacterial infections.19 Commercially available immunoassay testing kits are a more precise and less variable method for specimen analysis compared with fecal leukocytes, with a sensitivity greater than 90% and a specificity greater than 70%.20 Although there is some debate as to whether fecal lactoferrin is clearly superior to fecal leukocytes, the speed and simplicity of lactoferrin testing make it the preferred method to screen for the presence of leukocytes when indicated.21
STOOL CULTURES
The indiscriminate use of stool cultures in the evaluation of acute diarrhea is inefficient (results are positive in only 1.6% to 5.6% of cases)1 and expensive, with an estimated cost of $900 to $1,200 per positive stool culture.22 Obtaining cultures only in patients with screening tests positive for leukocytes decreases the cost to $150 per positive culture.23 Obtaining cultures only in patients with grossly bloody stools increases the yield for positive culture results to greater than 30%.24
Although there is no consensus on which patients need a culture, it is reasonable to perform a culture if the patient has grossly bloody stool, severe dehydration, signs of inflammatory disease, symptoms lasting more than three to seven days, or immunosuppression.25,26 Cultures are often obtained for traveler's diarrhea; however, empiric treatment is also an option.1,11 In the hospital setting, cultures should be reserved for the reasons listed above or if diarrhea begins more than three days after admission and there has been a nosocomial outbreak, the patient has human immunodeficiency virus infection or neutropenia, or the patient is older than 65 years with significant comorbidity (e.g., end-stage liver, renal, or pulmonary disease; leukemia hemiparesis caused by cardiovascular accident; inflammatory bowel disease).25
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TESTING
Testing for Clostridium difficile toxins A and B is recommended for patients who develop unexplained diarrhea after three days of hospitalization; the test will be positive in 15% to 20% of these patients.25,27 Furthermore, the risk of contracting C. difficile infection increases by seven to 10 times throughout any period of antibiotic treatment and for the first month after antibiotic discontinuation, and this risk is still three times higher in the second and third months after antibiotic discontinuation.28 Therefore, testing for C. difficile toxins is also suggested in patients who develop unexplained diarrhea while using antibiotics or within three months of discontinuing antibiotics. C. difficile testing can be considered in certain populations with significant comorbidities, including older persons and those who are immunocompromised.
OVA AND PARASITES
Routine analysis for ova and parasites in patients with acute diarrhea is not cost-effective, especially in developed countries.29 Indications for ova and parasite testing include persistent diarrhea lasting more than seven days, especially if associated with infants in day care or travel to mountainous regions; diarrhea in persons with AIDS or men who have sex with men; community waterborne outbreaks; or bloody diarrhea with few fecal leukocytes.11 The benefit of sending multiple samples to increase the test yield is debatable.
ENDOSCOPY
The role of endoscopy in the diagnosis and management of acute diarrhea is limited. Endoscopic evaluation may be considered if the diagnosis is unclear after routine blood and stool tests, if empiric therapy is ineffective, or if symptoms persist.30 Specifically, lower endoscopy with colonic biopsy and culture can be helpful in patients with diarrhea and suspected tuberculosis or diffuse colitis (as in C. difficile colitis) and in determining noninfectious causes of acute diarrhea, such as inflammatory bowel disease, ischemic colitis, enteropathy related to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and cancer.31
Treatment
Figure 1 provides an algorithm for the treatment of acute diarrhea.1,14,20
REHYDRATION THERAPY
The first step to treating acute diarrhea is rehydration, preferably oral rehydration.1 The accumulated fluid deficit (calculated roughly as the difference between the patient's normal weight and his or her weight at presentation with diarrheal illness) must first be addressed. Next, the focus should turn to the replacement of ongoing losses and the continuation of maintenance fluids. An oral rehydration solution (ORS) must contain a mixture of salt and glucose in combination with water to best use the intestine's sodium-glucose coupled cellular transport mechanism.
In 2002, the World Health Organization endorsed an ORS with reduced osmolarity (250 mOsm per L or less compared with the prior standard of 311 mOsm per L). The reduced osmolarity ORS decreases stool outputs, episodes of emesis, and the need for intravenous rehydration,32 without increasing hyponatremia, compared with the standard ORS.33 A reduced osmolarity ORS can be roughly duplicated by mixing 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 6 teaspoons of sugar, and 1 liter of water. If oral rehydration is not feasible, intravenous rehydration may be necessary.
FEEDING
Early refeeding decreases intestinal permeability caused by infections, reduces illness duration, and improves nutritional outcomes.34,35 This is particularly important in developing countries where underlying preexisting malnutrition is often a factor. Although the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) and the avoidance of dairy are commonly recommended, supporting data for these interventions are limited. Instructing patients to refrain from eating solid food for 24 hours also does not appear useful.36
ANTIDIARRHEAL MEDICATIONS
The antimotility agent loperamide (Imodium) may reduce the duration of diarrhea by as much as one day and increase the likelihood of clinical cure at 24 and 48 hours when given with antibiotics for traveler's diarrhea.37,38 A loperamide/simethicone combination has demonstrated faster and more complete relief of acute nonspecific diarrhea and gas-related discomfort compared with either medication alone.39
Loperamide may cause dangerous prolongation of illness in patients with some forms of bloody or inflammatory diarrhea and, therefore, should be restricted to patients with nonbloody stool.40 The antisecretory drug bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) is a safe alternative in patients with fever and inflammatory diarrhea. There is inadequate evidence to recommend the use of the absorbents kaolin/pectin, activated charcoal, or attapulgite (no longer available in the United States). The antisecretory drug racecadotril, widely used in Europe but unavailable in the United States, appears to be more tolerable and as effective as loperamide.41
ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY
Because acute diarrhea is most often self-limited and caused by viruses, routine antibiotic use is not recommended for most adults with nonsevere, watery diarrhea. Additionally, the overuse of antibiotics can lead to resistance (e.g., Campylobacter), harmful eradication of normal flora, prolongation of illness (e.g., superinfection with C. difficile), prolongation of carrier state (e.g., delayed excretion of Salmonella), induction of Shiga toxins (e.g., from Shiga toxinï¿½producing E. coli), and increased cost.
However, when used appropriately, antibiotics are effective for shigellosis, campylobacteriosis, C. difficile, traveler's diarrhea, and protozoal infections. Antibiotic treatment of traveler's diarrhea (usually a quinolone) is associated with decreased severity of illness and a two-or three-day reduction in duration of illness.1,42 If the patient's clinical presentation suggests the possibility of Shiga toxinï¿½producing E. coli (e.g., bloody diarrhea, history of eating seed sprouts or rare ground beef, proximity to an outbreak), antibiotic use should be avoided because it may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome.43 Conservative management without antibiotic treatment is less successful for diarrhea lasting more than 10 to 14 days, and testing and treatment for protozoal infections should be considered.1 Antibiotics may be considered in patients who are older than 65 years, immunocompromised, severely ill, or septic. Table 4 summarizes antibiotic therapy for acute diarrhea.1,14,16,44,45

PROBIOTICS
Probiotics are thought to work by stimulating the immune system and competing for binding sites on intestinal epithelial cells. Their use in children with acute diarrhea is associated with reduced severity and duration of illness (an average of about one less day of illness).46 Although many species are generally categorized as probiotics, even closely related strains may have different clinical effects. Effects of strain-specific probiotics need to be verified in adult studies before a specific evidence-based recommendation can be made.16
ZINC SUPPLEMENTATION
Research in children suggests that zinc supplementation (20 mg per day for 10 days in children older than two months) may play a crucial role in treating and preventing acute diarrhea, particularly in developing countries. Studies demonstrate a decrease in the risk of dehydration, and in the duration and severity of the diarrheal episode by an estimated 20% to 40%.47 Additional research is needed to evaluate potential benefits of zinc supplementation in the adult population.
Prevention
Good hygiene, hand washing, safe food preparation, and access to clean water are key factors in preventing diarrheal illness.48 Public health interventions to promote hand washing alone can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by about one-third.49 Vaccine development remains a high priority for disease prevention, particularly for those in the developing world. Effective and safe vaccines exist for rotavirus, typhoid fever, and cholera, and are under investigation for Campylobacter, enterotoxigenic E. coli, and Shigella infections. To contain disease outbreaks, designated diseases should be reported to public health authorities. In the United States, reportable diarrheal illnesses include those caused by Vibrio cholerae, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Shiga toxinï¿½producing E. coli.

HealthlineHealth ConditionsDiscoverPlanConnectSubscribeFever of Unknown OriginMedically reviewed by Graham Rogers, M.D.  Written by Maureen Ash 
Updated on August 31, 2018TypesCausesSymptomsTestsTreatmentIn childrenOutlookA fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a fever of at least 101°F (38.3°C) that lasts for more than three weeks or occurs frequently without explanation. Even when a doctor cant determine the cause of the fever at first, a diagnosis is a step toward treating it. TypeThere are four classifications of FUO.ClassicClassic FUO affects previously healthy people. Its defined as an unexplained fever that lasts for three weeks. Infection or neoplasms, such as leukemia, may cause classic FUO. Other disorders, such as diseases that affect connective tissue, can also be the cause.NosocomialPeople with nosocomial FUO appear to get a fever as a result of hospitalization. Theyre admitted for something other than fever and then begin to run the unexplained fever. Common causes include:pulmonary embolismenterocolitissinusitisdeep vein thrombosisseptic thrombophlebitis, a type of inflammation that affects the veinsImmune-deficientImmune-deficient FUO occurs in people with compromised immune systems. This puts them at increased risk of infection. A compromised immune system can often occur because of chemotherapy treatment.HIV-associatedHIV itself can cause fevers. HIV also makes a person susceptible to infections that may cause fevers.Learn more: Understanding and managing HIV fever » CausesRecognizing the type of FUO helps a physician find its cause. Causes of FUO can be categorized as any of the following:infection: tuberculosis, mononucleosis, Lyme disease, cat scratch fever, endocarditis, and othersinflammation: lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and othersmalignancy: lymphoma, leukemia, pancreatic carcinoma, and other cancers and sarcomasmiscellaneous: fevers caused by drug use or abuse,hyperthyroidism, hepatitis, and factors that dont fit into other categoriesA person with a FUO is given several clinical tests to narrow down the FUOs classification. Diagnosis of the FUO can also draw attention to an otherwise undiagnosed condition. SymptomsFUO may be accompanied by other symptoms that can help doctors determine the underlying cause. Typical symptoms of a fever include:a temperature that exceeds 100.4°F (38°C) for babies or 99.5°F (37.5°C) for children and adultssweatingchillsheadachesOther symptoms that typically accompany fever include:body or joint achesweaknesssore throatfatiguecoughrashsinus congestion Diagnostic tests for FUOIn some cases, a wait-and-see approach is often used for short-term fevers that arent accompanied by any red flag symptoms. Once a fever lasts long enough to be classified as a fever of unknown origin, your doctor may run some tests to determine the underlying cause.InterviewYour doctor will likely ask if youve:been out of the countryhad any environmental exposureshad any changes in your daily environmentIf you work with animals, your doctor may consider animal-borne illnesses. Theyll also ask about your family history and illnesses such as lymphoma or rheumatic fever. Blood work and physical examYour doctor may also run blood tests to check for certain conditions, including autoimmune conditions that might not have many obvious symptoms. Theyll examine your skin carefully for signs of pallor, rash, or jaundice. If blood work or the physical exam turns up any positive indicators, the doctor will order more tests before confirming a diagnosis. Culture testsBlood, urine, and sputum cultures may be used to check for causes such as bacteria and fungi. Special tests can also help check for atypical bacterial, fungal, or viral infections. Imaging testsAn endocardiogram may be used to evaluate your heart if your doctor hears a murmur or strongly suspects endocarditis. This is an infection of one of the heart valves. Chest X-rays may be used to inspect the lungs.
TreatmentAccording to American Family Physician, people with FUO are discharged without a definitive diagnosis in up to 50 percent of cases. In many of these cases, FUO resolves itself in time.Treatment for a FUO varies depending on the cause. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antihistamines may also be used to treat FUOs that have no trace of underlying causes. In many people, these medications can help reduce the fever itself. People whose fevers are thought to have an immune-deficient origin may be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. These target the most likely pathogens. Infections are responsible for between 20 and 40 percent of all fevers of unknown origin.In people with HIV-associated fevers, treatment focuses on treating HIV with antiviral drugs. After that, any associated symptoms or complications that may stem from it will be addressed.
Recognizing FUO in childrenFevers occur commonly in children of all ages, particularly infants and toddlers. Your child may have a fever if they:are less active or talkative than normalhave decreased appetite or increased thirst have fussier behavior (especially common in infants and toddlers)say that they feel warm or hotIf your childs fever reaches 102.2°F (39°C), it should be treated. You can give them acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil), but you should not give them aspirin (Bayer). In children, aspirin is associated with a very serious condition known as Reyes syndrome. Certain symptoms require immediate medical attention. This includes if your childs fever goes up to 105°F (40.6°C). You should also contact the pediatrician if your child:cries inconsolablyhas a stiff neckstruggles to breathehas purple rashes appear on the skinhas trouble waking upcant swallow OutlookMany fevers of unknown origin are impossible to diagnose, and they can resolve without treatment. Nevertheless, a fever lasting three weeks or more can indicate a serious health issue. You should see your doctor to check for underlying causes, especially if you have other symptoms. If you experience any emergency symptoms in combination with a fever, seek medical attention immediately.

on July 21, 2021Why a fever causes chillsTreatmentAssociated symptoms Seeking helpPreventionSummaryPeople often experience chills with a fever. They may feel very cold, shiver, or shake. They might also alternate between feeling very cold and very hot.Share on PinterestWestend61/Getty ImagesMany other symptoms may also occur with a fever, including a more rapid heart rate, faster breathing, changes in metabolism, and increased activity in the immune system. This increased immune activity may help a person fight off an infection. The body retains the ability to regulate temperature, so most fevers are not dangerous. That said, it is also important to note that some infections leading to a fever can be dangerous. Less commonly, a fever with chills might signal another problem, such as a reaction to a medication or cancer. There are many viral and bacterial infections that can cause a sudden fever with chills. Keep reading to learn more about why a fever may cause chills, how and when to treat these symptoms, and when to contact a doctor.Why does a fever cause chills? When a person has a fever, muscle contractions cause shaking and shivering. The purpose of these muscle contractions is to raise body temperature to help a person fight an infection or another illness. The hypothalamus sits at the base of the brain. It is the small area responsible for temperature regulation, among other things. It is the part of the brain that establishes a healthy set point, or an optimum level, for a persons temperature, which is around 37ºC (98.6ºF). When body temperature deviates from this, the body tries to return itself to the optimum temperature. It may do this by causing sweating to lower temperature or shivering to raise temperature. When a person has a fever, the set point increases as the body tries to fight the infection. As long as a persons body temperature is below this set point, they will feel cold. The feeling of coldness, or of being below the new optimum temperature, leads to shivering. This shivering helps raise body temperature and may also encourage a person to put on more clothing or take other measures to keep warm. TreatmentPeople who wish to treat a fever can try over-the-counter anti-fever medications, such as acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen. Never give a child aspirin, as this increases the risk of a rare but life threatening condition called Reyes syndrome. Drinking plenty of fluids can help prevent dehydration. There is no need to take ice baths, remove clothing, or do anything else that causes discomfort. If the fever is very high and does not respond to medication, or if a person has other symptoms of severe illness  such as a stiff neck, confusion, or difficulty breathing  contact a doctor or go to the emergency room. Most fevers, even high fevers, are not dangerous. This is because the body can still regulate its temperature and only has to set the optimum temperature higher than the usual 37ºC (98.6ºF). Treating a fever will not cure the underlying illness, and many doctors argue that treating a fever serves no medical purpose. In fact, there is little scientific evidence supporting the treatment of fevers.One 2020 paper argues that for minor infections that are likely to go away on their own, treating a fever is probably harmless. However, for more serious infections  such as COVID-19  treating a fever may suppress the bodys natural immune response, which could slow recovery and increase the risk of long-term complications. There are some exceptions to this rule, however. People with weak immune systems due to having cancer, having HIV, or taking immunosuppressant drugs should contact a doctor right away for a fever. Also, in newborns younger than 3 months old, a rectal temperature higher than 38ºC (100.4ºF) or an oral temperature above 37.5ºC (99.5ºF) warrants a doctors visit. Associated symptoms Some other symptoms a person might experience along with a fever include: shaking or shiveringfeeling very coldfeeling hot when the fever breaks or after taking fever medication symptoms of illness, such as a cough, an earache, or muscle pain intense exhaustionvomiting or diarrhea Sometimes, the symptoms that accompany a fever offer a clue about its cause. For example, a person who has a fever and an earache may have an ear infection. It is not always possible to self-diagnose, however. People who have reactions to medications that cause fevers may develop other symptoms of illness, such as muscle pain or a runny nose. Learn more about the symptoms of a fever here.When to contact a doctorIt is important to contact a doctor if: A person develops any symptoms of a serious illness, such as meningitis. These symptoms may include a stiff neck, confusion, or sensitivity to light. Symptoms of a milder illness continue to worsen or do not go away after a few days. A newborn under 3 months old has a fever. A person with a serious illness or a weak immune system gets a fever. A person has chronic, unexplained fevers. A person develops a fever after taking a new medication. PreventionOften, the best strategy for preventing fevers is to prevent the infections that cause them. The following tips may help: Stay home when sick, and do not send sick children to daycare or school. Know that treating a fever does not prevent it from spreading. If a person still has a fever despite taking medications, they may still be contagious. Get all recommended vaccines. Practice regular hand-washing with soap and warm water, especially before eating, before touching the face, and after touching someone else. Try to avoid people who are sick. If doing so is impossible, wear a mask and frequently wash the hands. Practice safer sex to reduce the spread of sexually transmitted infections. In crowded areas where COVID-19 rates are high, wear a mask indoors. Practice safe food preparation, including using different utensils for different foods, heating food according to the manufacturers instructions, and washing the hands before and after touching raw meat. SummaryA fever will often present with chills, as it is the bodys reaction to trying to raise its core temperature to an optimum level when fighting certain infections and viruses.A fever can be very unpleasant, and it may cause painful symptoms  even when the cause is a relatively minor illness. However, a fever is the bodys normal reaction to an infection or illness, and it is not a reason to panic. Although the infections that cause fevers can be dangerous, fevers themselves are rarely dangerous. People should aim to focus on self-care and comfort strategies, such as getting warm, resting, and drinking plenty of fluids. Taking a fever medication may ease the symptoms and help a person rest better. Most fevers will go away on their own. However, if the accompanying symptoms are very severe, get worse, or do not resolve within a few days, contact a doctor.

Treatment
Most healthcare providers define a low-grade fever as a temperature between 99 degrees F (37.2 C) and 100.4 degrees F (38.0 C). A normal body temperature is typically described as 98.6 F (37 C) but can range from 97 F (36.1 C) to 99 F (37.2 C).
A low-grade fever is often the first sign of an infection. When the body temperature is normal, infectious bacteria and viruses are able to thrive. A fever is the body's way of creating a hostile environment to help neutralize them.
Low-grade fevers also have non-infectious causes, including diseases, vaccines, and medications that affect the body's "thermostat," known as the hypothalamus.
This article explains the symptoms and causes of low-grade fevers. It also offers tips on how to manage a fever and when it is time to see a healthcare provider.
Low-Grade Fever Symptoms
Although fever is the body's defense against infectionincreasing the internal temperature to where most bacteria and viruses are unable to surviveit can cause a cascade of symptoms the higher the temperature gets.
With a low-grade fever, the condition is often asymptomatic (without symptoms) or subclinical (not severe enough to cause definite or recognized symptoms). If symptoms do occur, they will often be mild and cause:
HeadacheFatigue and tirednessGeneral achinessMild sweating
A low-grade fever is generally not cause for concern unless it is persistent or accompanied by other, more serious symptoms such as pain, vomiting, or dizziness.
Low-Grade Fever in Children
A low-grade fever in children is between 99 F (37.2 C) and 100.3 F (37.9 C). If your child is 3 months or younger, call their healthcare provider if there is any fever, even a low-grade one. Fevers considered mild in adults can sometimes be a sign of a serious infection in newborns and infants.
When to See a Healthcare Provider
There are times when a fever warrants a call to your healthcare provider or an immediate visit to the emergency room.
Adults
Seek medical care for a fever that appears with these other symptoms:
Stiff neck, which can indicate a potentially life-threatening condition called meningitis affecting the brain and spinal cord
Feeling sleepy, dull, or confused
Persistent vomiting and/or diarrhea
Persistent sore throat
Seizure or loss of consciousness
Pain or burning with urination
A rash that looks like purple spots
Fevers of any kind can be stressful. But its important to remember that most low-grade fevers are harmless and will run their course in a few days or less. Call your healthcare provider if youre worried about symptoms or simply need advice or reassurance.
Infants and Children
Seek medical help right away if you child:
Seems lethargic, uncharacteristically fussy, or seems very ill
Has severe symptoms such as a stiff neck, a severe headache, or severe sore throat
Seems to be having trouble breathing
Has a rash accompanying the fever
Has repeated vomiting or diarrhea with the fever
Has underlying medical issues such as a heart condition or cancer
Takes steroids or immune-suppressant medication
Has a seizure (rapidly rising fevers can sometimes trigger febrile seizures in young children)
Is under 3 months and has a fever of 100.4 or higher
Has a fever of 104 or higher (at any age)
Call your child's healthcare provider if:
Your child is 2 years old or younger and their fever doesn't go away after 24 hours.Your child is older than 2 and their fever doesn't go away after 72 hours.Their condition seems to be worsening.They act sick after you've given them a fever reducer.There are any other symptoms that worry you. Follow your instincts and seek medical care.
Studies have shown that using touch to detect fever is unreliable. Up to 40% of people who try end up underestimating or entirely missing temperatures greater than 102 F (38.9 C).
What Causes a Low-Grade Fever?
A fevereven a low-grade oneis a sign that something is wrong in your body. It may indicate that your immune system is mounting a defense against a foreign invader like a virus or bacteria. Or, it may be due to non-infectious causes such as autoimmune diseases, medications, or even blood cancer.
Whatever the underlying cause, fever is ultimately the result of a trigger known as a pyrogen. This is any substance from within or outside of the body that stimulates the production of a substance called prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).
PGE2 acts on a part of the brain, called the hypothalamus, which regulates body temperature. It signals the hypothalamus to increase the temperature set point, causing the body to heat up.
There are both exogenous pyrogens like viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi that come from outside of the body and endogenous pyrogens like interferons and interleukins that are released by the body in response to injury or disease.
Verywell / Theresa Chiechi
Infectious Causes
Viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal infections can all cause low-grade fevers. Some function independently as pyrogens (like viruses), while others release toxins that are pyrogenic (like bacteria).
Examples include:
Chickenpox
Cholera
Coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever)
Cold viruses (including rhinoviruses)
COVID-19
Infectious mononucleosis
Influenza (flu)
Malaria
Measles
Mumps
Otitis media (middle ear infection)
Pneumonia
Rubella (German measles)
Sinusitis (sinus infections)
Strep throat
Urinary tract infections
Viral and bacterial gastroenteritis (stomach flu)
Non-Infectious Illnesses
There are diseases and conditions that can directly or indirectly trigger a low-grade fever. These include autoimmune diseases, hormonal disorders, inflammatory diseases, and conditions that cause the obstruction of major blood vessels or airways.
Examples include:
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease)
Aspiration pneumonia
Behçet syndrome
Blood transfusion
Cholecystitis
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
Gout
Hyperthyroidism
Menstruation
Leukemia
Lupus
Lymphoma
Pancreatitis
Pulmonary embolism
Stress (psychogenic fever)
Stroke
Rheumatoid arthritis
Certain medications can also trigger a low-grade fever, including:
Anticonvulsant drugs like phenytoin and carbamazepine
Antipsychotic drugs like haloperidol
Beta-lactam antibiotics
Cardiac arrhythmia drugs like amiodarone
HIV drugs like abacavir
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) antidepressants
Sulfa drugs
Vaccines
Fever of Unknown Origin
An unexplained fever equal to or higher than 101 F (38.3 C) that is persistent or recurrent may be classified as a fever of unknown origin (FUO). An FUO can develop independently or end up being a sign of a serious condition like cancer.
How to Treat a Low-Grade Fever
The general rule of thumb is to treat a low-grade fever only if it is causing discomfort. Some experts say that doesnt happen until a temperature hits 102 F (38.9 C) or higher.
If you decide to treat a low-grade fever, over-the-counter painkillers like Tylenol (acetaminophen) and Advil (ibuprofen) 410 are good choices.
Aspirin is another option, but never give aspirin to children unless instructed by your healthcare provider. Aspirin is associated with a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction called Reye's syndrome affecting children and teens with a virus-induced fever.
Other self-help measures include:
Drinking plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration caused by sweating and fever
Resting to help your body heal itself
Wearing light, breathable fabrics
Placing a cool, moist cloth on your forehead
Taking a cool bath (but not an ice bath which can cause hypothermia and increase your body temperature)
Should I Stay Home With a Fever?
A low-grade fever may be a sign of a developing infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises you to stay at home for at least 24 hours if you have a fever of 100 F (37.8 C) or greater, even if you have no other symptoms.
What to Take for Fever
Summary
A low-grade fever is between 99 degrees F (37.2 C) and 100.4 degrees F (38.0 C). It is usually nothing to worry about and will typically run its course in several days or less without treatment. Infections are the most common cause, but there are also non-infectious causes (including medications and stress).
Seek immediate medical care for a low-grade fever in children 3 months or under and anyone whose fever lasts for more than 72 hours.
A Word From Verywell
A low-grade fever, while not as dangerous as a high-grade fever, comes with its own challenges. Keep things like understanding body temperature, temperature measurement methods, nutrition, and alcohol consumption in mind to ensure you or your loved ones stay safe and healthy.

Updated on August 31, 2018TypesCausesSymptomsTestsTreatmentIn childrenOutlookA fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a fever of at least 101°F (38.3°C) that lasts for more than three weeks or occurs frequently without explanation. Even when a doctor cant determine the cause of the fever at first, a diagnosis is a step toward treating it. TypeThere are four classifications of FUO.ClassicClassic FUO affects previously healthy people. Its defined as an unexplained fever that lasts for three weeks. Infection or neoplasms, such as leukemia, may cause classic FUO. Other disorders, such as diseases that affect connective tissue, can also be the cause.NosocomialPeople with nosocomial FUO appear to get a fever as a result of hospitalization. Theyre admitted for something other than fever and then begin to run the unexplained fever. Common causes include:pulmonary embolismenterocolitissinusitisdeep vein thrombosisseptic thrombophlebitis, a type of inflammation that affects the veinsImmune-deficientImmune-deficient FUO occurs in people with compromised immune systems. This puts them at increased risk of infection. A compromised immune system can often occur because of chemotherapy treatment.HIV-associatedHIV itself can cause fevers. HIV also makes a person susceptible to infections that may cause fevers.Learn more: Understanding and managing HIV fever » CausesRecognizing the type of FUO helps a physician find its cause. Causes of FUO can be categorized as any of the following:infection: tuberculosis, mononucleosis, Lyme disease, cat scratch fever, endocarditis, and othersinflammation: lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and othersmalignancy: lymphoma, leukemia, pancreatic carcinoma, and other cancers and sarcomasmiscellaneous: fevers caused by drug use or abuse,hyperthyroidism, hepatitis, and factors that dont fit into other categoriesA person with a FUO is given several clinical tests to narrow down the FUOs classification. Diagnosis of the FUO can also draw attention to an otherwise undiagnosed condition. SymptomsFUO may be accompanied by other symptoms that can help doctors determine the underlying cause. Typical symptoms of a fever include:a temperature that exceeds 100.4°F (38°C) for babies or 99.5°F (37.5°C) for children and adultssweatingchillsheadachesOther symptoms that typically accompany fever include:body or joint achesweaknesssore throatfatiguecoughrashsinus congestion Diagnostic tests for FUOIn some cases, a wait-and-see approach is often used for short-term fevers that arent accompanied by any red flag symptoms. Once a fever lasts long enough to be classified as a fever of unknown origin, your doctor may run some tests to determine the underlying cause.InterviewYour doctor will likely ask if youve:been out of the countryhad any environmental exposureshad any changes in your daily environmentIf you work with animals, your doctor may consider animal-borne illnesses. Theyll also ask about your family history and illnesses such as lymphoma or rheumatic fever. Blood work and physical examYour doctor may also run blood tests to check for certain conditions, including autoimmune conditions that might not have many obvious symptoms. Theyll examine your skin carefully for signs of pallor, rash, or jaundice. If blood work or the physical exam turns up any positive indicators, the doctor will order more tests before confirming a diagnosis. Culture testsBlood, urine, and sputum cultures may be used to check for causes such as bacteria and fungi. Special tests can also help check for atypical bacterial, fungal, or viral infections. Imaging testsAn endocardiogram may be used to evaluate your heart if your doctor hears a murmur or strongly suspects endocarditis. This is an infection of one of the heart valves. Chest X-rays may be used to inspect the lungs.
TreatmentAccording to American Family Physician, people with FUO are discharged without a definitive diagnosis in up to 50 percent of cases. In many of these cases, FUO resolves itself in time.Treatment for a FUO varies depending on the cause. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antihistamines may also be used to treat FUOs that have no trace of underlying causes. In many people, these medications can help reduce the fever itself. People whose fevers are thought to have an immune-deficient origin may be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. These target the most likely pathogens. Infections are responsible for between 20 and 40 percent of all fevers of unknown origin.In people with HIV-associated fevers, treatment focuses on treating HIV with antiviral drugs. After that, any associated symptoms or complications that may stem from it will be addressed.
Recognizing FUO in childrenFevers occur commonly in children of all ages, particularly infants and toddlers. Your child may have a fever if they:are less active or talkative than normalhave decreased appetite or increased thirst have fussier behavior (especially common in infants and toddlers)say that they feel warm or hotIf your childs fever reaches 102.2°F (39°C), it should be treated. You can give them acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil), but you should not give them aspirin (Bayer). In children, aspirin is associated with a very serious condition known as Reyes syndrome. Certain symptoms require immediate medical attention. This includes if your childs fever goes up to 105°F (40.6°C). You should also contact the pediatrician if your child:cries inconsolablyhas a stiff neckstruggles to breathehas purple rashes appear on the skinhas trouble waking upcant swallow OutlookMany fevers of unknown origin are impossible to diagnose, and they can resolve without treatment. Nevertheless, a fever lasting three weeks or more can indicate a serious health issue. You should see your doctor to check for underlying causes, especially if you have other symptoms. If you experience any emergency symptoms in combination with a fever, seek medical attention immediately.

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm  or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs)  also known as your body's "thermostat"  monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children.

Fever in adults: When to worry
Infection is a common cause of fever, but other conditions can also bring the heat.
May 22, 2023
Reviewed by
Howard E. LeWine, MD,
Chief Medical Editor, Harvard Health Publishing
Fever is one of the body's most effective ways of fighting infection. It is part of your body's defense against infection-causing germs.
You get a fever most often when your body is trying to kill infectious invaders such as viruses or bacteria. A higher body temperature helps the immune system respond more vigorously to the attack, and makes it harder for these microbes to survive.
What is considered a fever in adults?
The average body temperature is 98.6° F (37°C). But "normal" body temperature varies from person to person. It also changes during the day, rising a bit after you eat or exercise. Body temperature is often higher in the afternoon than it is when you wake up in the morning.
Fever means a body temperature of 100.4° F (38°C) or higher.
High fever in adults
While any temperature above your normal temperature range is considered a fever, there are different levels of fever severity:
Low-grade: 99.1 to 100.4 F (37.3 to 38.0 C)
Moderate-grade: 100.6 to 102.2 F (38.1 to 39.0 C)
High-grade: 102.4 to 105.8 F (39.1 to 41 C).
When to worry about fever
If you have a fever over 104°F (40°C), you should call your doctor.
Seek medical help right away if you have a fever along with any of these symptoms:
seizure
loss of consciousness
confusion
stiff neck
trouble breathing
severe pain anywhere in the body
swelling or inflammation of any part of the body
vaginal discharge that is discolored or smells bad
pain when urinating or urine that smells bad.
Causes of fever
An infection, such as the flu, is the most common cause of fever.
Other conditions can also cause a fever. These include diseases that produce inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis; reactions to drugs or vaccines; and even certain types of cancers.
Accompanying symptoms
The following symptoms may also accompany fever:
sweats
chills
headache
achy muscles
lack of desire to eat
rash
restlessness
weakness.
A very high fever can cause confusion, extreme sleepiness, irritability, and seizures.
Diagnosing the cause of a fever
To help determine why you have a fever, your doctor will ask you about:
other symptoms such as coughing, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or pain when urinating
recent surgeries or injuries
recent vaccinations
new drugs you may be taking
recent travel, particularly travel abroad.
How to treat a fever at home
By itself, fever is usually harmless, though a high fever can be miserable. These steps may help you feel better:
Drink plenty of fluids to help cool your body and prevent dehydration.
Eat light foods that are easy to digest.
Get plenty of rest.
Take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, or others), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, or others), or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) to help relieve head and body aches and lower your temperature.
Take a slightly warm (not cool) bath, or apply damp washcloths to the forehead and wrists.

Updated on August 31, 2018TypesCausesSymptomsTestsTreatmentIn childrenOutlookA fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a fever of at least 101°F (38.3°C) that lasts for more than three weeks or occurs frequently without explanation. Even when a doctor cant determine the cause of the fever at first, a diagnosis is a step toward treating it. TypeThere are four classifications of FUO.ClassicClassic FUO affects previously healthy people. Its defined as an unexplained fever that lasts for three weeks. Infection or neoplasms, such as leukemia, may cause classic FUO. Other disorders, such as diseases that affect connective tissue, can also be the cause.NosocomialPeople with nosocomial FUO appear to get a fever as a result of hospitalization. Theyre admitted for something other than fever and then begin to run the unexplained fever. Common causes include:pulmonary embolismenterocolitissinusitisdeep vein thrombosisseptic thrombophlebitis, a type of inflammation that affects the veinsImmune-deficientImmune-deficient FUO occurs in people with compromised immune systems. This puts them at increased risk of infection. A compromised immune system can often occur because of chemotherapy treatment.HIV-associatedHIV itself can cause fevers. HIV also makes a person susceptible to infections that may cause fevers.Learn more: Understanding and managing HIV fever » CausesRecognizing the type of FUO helps a physician find its cause. Causes of FUO can be categorized as any of the following:infection: tuberculosis, mononucleosis, Lyme disease, cat scratch fever, endocarditis, and othersinflammation: lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and othersmalignancy: lymphoma, leukemia, pancreatic carcinoma, and other cancers and sarcomasmiscellaneous: fevers caused by drug use or abuse,hyperthyroidism, hepatitis, and factors that dont fit into other categoriesA person with a FUO is given several clinical tests to narrow down the FUOs classification. Diagnosis of the FUO can also draw attention to an otherwise undiagnosed condition. SymptomsFUO may be accompanied by other symptoms that can help doctors determine the underlying cause. Typical symptoms of a fever include:a temperature that exceeds 100.4°F (38°C) for babies or 99.5°F (37.5°C) for children and adultssweatingchillsheadachesOther symptoms that typically accompany fever include:body or joint achesweaknesssore throatfatiguecoughrashsinus congestion Diagnostic tests for FUOIn some cases, a wait-and-see approach is often used for short-term fevers that arent accompanied by any red flag symptoms. Once a fever lasts long enough to be classified as a fever of unknown origin, your doctor may run some tests to determine the underlying cause.InterviewYour doctor will likely ask if youve:been out of the countryhad any environmental exposureshad any changes in your daily environmentIf you work with animals, your doctor may consider animal-borne illnesses. Theyll also ask about your family history and illnesses such as lymphoma or rheumatic fever. Blood work and physical examYour doctor may also run blood tests to check for certain conditions, including autoimmune conditions that might not have many obvious symptoms. Theyll examine your skin carefully for signs of pallor, rash, or jaundice. If blood work or the physical exam turns up any positive indicators, the doctor will order more tests before confirming a diagnosis. Culture testsBlood, urine, and sputum cultures may be used to check for causes such as bacteria and fungi. Special tests can also help check for atypical bacterial, fungal, or viral infections. Imaging testsAn endocardiogram may be used to evaluate your heart if your doctor hears a murmur or strongly suspects endocarditis. This is an infection of one of the heart valves. Chest X-rays may be used to inspect the lungs.
TreatmentAccording to American Family Physician, people with FUO are discharged without a definitive diagnosis in up to 50 percent of cases. In many of these cases, FUO resolves itself in time.Treatment for a FUO varies depending on the cause. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antihistamines may also be used to treat FUOs that have no trace of underlying causes. In many people, these medications can help reduce the fever itself. People whose fevers are thought to have an immune-deficient origin may be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. These target the most likely pathogens. Infections are responsible for between 20 and 40 percent of all fevers of unknown origin.In people with HIV-associated fevers, treatment focuses on treating HIV with antiviral drugs. After that, any associated symptoms or complications that may stem from it will be addressed.
Recognizing FUO in childrenFevers occur commonly in children of all ages, particularly infants and toddlers. Your child may have a fever if they:are less active or talkative than normalhave decreased appetite or increased thirst have fussier behavior (especially common in infants and toddlers)say that they feel warm or hotIf your childs fever reaches 102.2°F (39°C), it should be treated. You can give them acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil), but you should not give them aspirin (Bayer). In children, aspirin is associated with a very serious condition known as Reyes syndrome. Certain symptoms require immediate medical attention. This includes if your childs fever goes up to 105°F (40.6°C). You should also contact the pediatrician if your child:cries inconsolablyhas a stiff neckstruggles to breathehas purple rashes appear on the skinhas trouble waking upcant swallow OutlookMany fevers of unknown origin are impossible to diagnose, and they can resolve without treatment. Nevertheless, a fever lasting three weeks or more can indicate a serious health issue. You should see your doctor to check for underlying causes, especially if you have other symptoms. If you experience any emergency symptoms in combination with a fever, seek medical attention immediately.

on July 21, 2021Why a fever causes chillsTreatmentAssociated symptoms Seeking helpPreventionSummaryPeople often experience chills with a fever. They may feel very cold, shiver, or shake. They might also alternate between feeling very cold and very hot.Share on PinterestWestend61/Getty ImagesMany other symptoms may also occur with a fever, including a more rapid heart rate, faster breathing, changes in metabolism, and increased activity in the immune system. This increased immune activity may help a person fight off an infection. The body retains the ability to regulate temperature, so most fevers are not dangerous. That said, it is also important to note that some infections leading to a fever can be dangerous. Less commonly, a fever with chills might signal another problem, such as a reaction to a medication or cancer. There are many viral and bacterial infections that can cause a sudden fever with chills. Keep reading to learn more about why a fever may cause chills, how and when to treat these symptoms, and when to contact a doctor.Why does a fever cause chills? When a person has a fever, muscle contractions cause shaking and shivering. The purpose of these muscle contractions is to raise body temperature to help a person fight an infection or another illness. The hypothalamus sits at the base of the brain. It is the small area responsible for temperature regulation, among other things. It is the part of the brain that establishes a healthy set point, or an optimum level, for a persons temperature, which is around 37ºC (98.6ºF). When body temperature deviates from this, the body tries to return itself to the optimum temperature. It may do this by causing sweating to lower temperature or shivering to raise temperature. When a person has a fever, the set point increases as the body tries to fight the infection. As long as a persons body temperature is below this set point, they will feel cold. The feeling of coldness, or of being below the new optimum temperature, leads to shivering. This shivering helps raise body temperature and may also encourage a person to put on more clothing or take other measures to keep warm. TreatmentPeople who wish to treat a fever can try over-the-counter anti-fever medications, such as acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen. Never give a child aspirin, as this increases the risk of a rare but life threatening condition called Reyes syndrome. Drinking plenty of fluids can help prevent dehydration. There is no need to take ice baths, remove clothing, or do anything else that causes discomfort. If the fever is very high and does not respond to medication, or if a person has other symptoms of severe illness  such as a stiff neck, confusion, or difficulty breathing  contact a doctor or go to the emergency room. Most fevers, even high fevers, are not dangerous. This is because the body can still regulate its temperature and only has to set the optimum temperature higher than the usual 37ºC (98.6ºF). Treating a fever will not cure the underlying illness, and many doctors argue that treating a fever serves no medical purpose. In fact, there is little scientific evidence supporting the treatment of fevers.One 2020 paper argues that for minor infections that are likely to go away on their own, treating a fever is probably harmless. However, for more serious infections  such as COVID-19  treating a fever may suppress the bodys natural immune response, which could slow recovery and increase the risk of long-term complications. There are some exceptions to this rule, however. People with weak immune systems due to having cancer, having HIV, or taking immunosuppressant drugs should contact a doctor right away for a fever. Also, in newborns younger than 3 months old, a rectal temperature higher than 38ºC (100.4ºF) or an oral temperature above 37.5ºC (99.5ºF) warrants a doctors visit. Associated symptoms Some other symptoms a person might experience along with a fever include: shaking or shiveringfeeling very coldfeeling hot when the fever breaks or after taking fever medication symptoms of illness, such as a cough, an earache, or muscle pain intense exhaustionvomiting or diarrhea Sometimes, the symptoms that accompany a fever offer a clue about its cause. For example, a person who has a fever and an earache may have an ear infection. It is not always possible to self-diagnose, however. People who have reactions to medications that cause fevers may develop other symptoms of illness, such as muscle pain or a runny nose. Learn more about the symptoms of a fever here.When to contact a doctorIt is important to contact a doctor if: A person develops any symptoms of a serious illness, such as meningitis. These symptoms may include a stiff neck, confusion, or sensitivity to light. Symptoms of a milder illness continue to worsen or do not go away after a few days. A newborn under 3 months old has a fever. A person with a serious illness or a weak immune system gets a fever. A person has chronic, unexplained fevers. A person develops a fever after taking a new medication. PreventionOften, the best strategy for preventing fevers is to prevent the infections that cause them. The following tips may help: Stay home when sick, and do not send sick children to daycare or school. Know that treating a fever does not prevent it from spreading. If a person still has a fever despite taking medications, they may still be contagious. Get all recommended vaccines. Practice regular hand-washing with soap and warm water, especially before eating, before touching the face, and after touching someone else. Try to avoid people who are sick. If doing so is impossible, wear a mask and frequently wash the hands. Practice safer sex to reduce the spread of sexually transmitted infections. In crowded areas where COVID-19 rates are high, wear a mask indoors. Practice safe food preparation, including using different utensils for different foods, heating food according to the manufacturers instructions, and washing the hands before and after touching raw meat. SummaryA fever will often present with chills, as it is the bodys reaction to trying to raise its core temperature to an optimum level when fighting certain infections and viruses.A fever can be very unpleasant, and it may cause painful symptoms  even when the cause is a relatively minor illness. However, a fever is the bodys normal reaction to an infection or illness, and it is not a reason to panic. Although the infections that cause fevers can be dangerous, fevers themselves are rarely dangerous. People should aim to focus on self-care and comfort strategies, such as getting warm, resting, and drinking plenty of fluids. Taking a fever medication may ease the symptoms and help a person rest better. Most fevers will go away on their own. However, if the accompanying symptoms are very severe, get worse, or do not resolve within a few days, contact a doctor.

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm  or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs)  also known as your body's "thermostat"  monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children.

A fever is when you have a brief rise in body temperature thats higher than your normal body temperature. Its also called a high temperature, hyperthermia, or pyrexia. It's usually a sign your immune system is working to fight some type of infection. Fever temperaturesNormal body temperatures are different for everyone, but they usually fall within the range of 97 to 99 degrees F. A temperature of 100.4 or higher is considered a fever, but there is no medical standard. The type of thermometer you use affects the temperature you get, as some are more accurate than others. Here's a breakdown of what's considered a fever by age and temperature: Babies age 0-2 years100.4 F (rectal, forehead, or ear temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature)Children ages 2-5 years100.4 F (rectal, forehead, or ear temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature)Children ages 5 and older100.4 F (ear temperature)100 F (oral temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature) Adults100.4 F (oral temperature)A low-grade fever is when you have a temperature that is slightly higher than normal, usually around 99.5 to 100.3 F. A low-grade fever signals that something is going on to activate your immune system.When Is Fever Dangerous?A fever can make you uncomfortable, but it's generally not cause for concern. You can often manage a fever at home, but in some cases you should call your doctor. Fever in babies: When to worryCheck in with your doctor if your baby younger than 3 months:Has a rectal temperature higher than 100.4 F. Has fever higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Has other symptoms, such as a cough or diarrhea.Call 911 or go to the ER if your baby has a seizure.Check in with your doctor if your baby 3 to 6 months old: Has a rectal or oral temperature higher than 100.4 F and is also irritable or sleepy.Has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Call your doctor or go to the ER if your baby won't stop crying and cant be consoled.  Fever in children: When to worryYou should reach out to your pediatrician if your child 6 months to 2 years:Has a fever higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Has other symptoms, such as a cough or diarrhea.If their fever comes with rash, real discomfort, irritability, low energy, headache, stiff neck, or repeated diarrhea or vomiting.Their fever is higher than 104 F, which can cause a seizure.Call 911 or go to the ER if your child has a seizure.Their fever doesnt go down after taking over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen.They've recently had vaccines.Fever in adults: When to worryCall your doctor or visit urgent care or an emergency room if:You have a temperature of 103 F or higher.Your fever doesnt go down after taking over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen.Youve been in contact with someone who has COVID-19.If you have a fever that is 102 degrees or higher, especially if you're in your first trimester of pregnancy. When to call the doctorCall 911 if you or your child have any of these symptoms:UnresponsiveWheezing or difficulty breathingBlue lipsConvulsions or seizuresSpeaking in a confused way A fever with a stiff neck or headacheTemperature higher than 105 FFever with sudden onset of rashSevere stomach pain or persistent vomitingSkin rashes, blisters, or a red streak on an arm or legA severe sore throat, swelling of the throat, or earachePain with urination (peeing), back pain, or shaking chillsA serious cough, or coughing up bloodContact your doctor if your fever lasts for more than 3 days or gets worse.Fever SymptomsA fever is a sign of an illness or infection. When you have one, you may notice these symptoms:Chills or shiveringSweatingBody achesHeadacheLethargy (feeling weak)Being irritableLoss of appetiteDehydrationRed or flushed faceBabies and children might also have:Earache (or pulling at their ears)High-pitch criesLoss of appetiteExtra thirstLow urine output (peeing less than usual)What Causes Fever?A fever can be a sign of several health conditions, which may or may not need medical treatment.The most common causes are infections such as colds and stomach bugs (gastroenteritis). Other causes include:Infections of the ear, lung, skin, throat, bladder, or kidneyHeat exhaustionViral infections like the flu or COVID-19SunburnConditions that cause inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritisSide effects of medicationsVaccines and immunizationsBlood clotsAutoimmune conditions such as lupus and inflammatory bowel disease (IBS)CancerHormone disorders such as hyperthyroidismIllegal drugs such as amphetamines and cocaineTeething in babies can cause a mild, low-grade fever (not over 101 degrees).Fever DiagnosisAlthough a fever is easy to measure with a thermometer, finding its cause can be hard. If you see your doctor, they'll do a physical exam and ask questions about your symptoms, other health conditions you have, medications you take, and if you've recently traveled to areas that have health risks. A malaria infection, for example, may cause a high fever that gets better and then comes back in cycles. Some areas of the U.S. are hot spots for infections such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Your doctor may ask if you have been around someone with COVID-19 or have any other symptoms of COVID-19.Sometimes, you may have a "fever of unknown origin." That means whatever's causing your fever isn't clear. Instead, it could be more unusual like a connective tissue disorder (diseases that affect things like your tendons, ligaments, skin, or cartilage), cancer, or another health problem. Your doctor may need to run tests to figure out the cause.Fever TreatmentsThe most common treatments for fever include over-the-counter drugs such as acetaminophen  and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen. Talk to your doctor about the proper dosage. Never give young children and teens aspirin. It's linked to a rare condition called Reyes syndrome that could damage their liver and brain.What is the best way to treat a fever at home?Drink a lot of clear liquids such as water, broth, and juices. Take a lukewarm bath. Do not use cold water or alcohol.Get plenty of rest. Keep yourself cool with lightweight clothing and bed coverings.If you get the chills, use an extra blanket until they go away.Types of FeverFevers have a wide range of causes, and you might hear your doctor call your fever a certain name. That's because doctors classify five types of fevers based on their patterns.Intermittent. With this type of fever, your temperature rises, but falls back to a normal range during the day. The difference can range from a small increase to about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Remittent. This type of fever rises and falls, but your temperature always stays above normal. Continuous or sustained. Your temperature stays about the same throughout the day. Hectic. This causes big swings in temperature, about 2 degrees F or more, throughout the day. You may also have symptoms like chills and sweats. Relapsing. A relapsing fever spikes after a few days or even weeks of normal temperature. Fever ComplicationsMost fevers get better without any problems, but some can have rare complications, especially in young children.If your child is aged 6 months to 5 years, a fever could put them at risk of a febrile seizure. They usually occur when your child's fever is higher than 100.4 F.  Signs your child could be having a febrile seizure include: They lose consciousness.Their arms and legs shake.Stiff or twitching one side of their body.Febrile seizures usually happen within the first 24 hours of your child's fever, and they might be the first sign your child is sick. Call 911 or your doctor immediately, even if the seizure lasts just a few seconds.  Sources

People with NDPH have a headache that wont stop and doesnt get better with common treatments. For some people, the headache can last years or never goes away. Treatment options are available but arent always successful.ContentsArrow DownOverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionOutlook / PrognosisLiving WithAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionOutlook / PrognosisLiving WithAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat is new daily persistent headache?New daily persistent headache (NDPH) is a rare chronic headache disorder. The symptoms of the NDPH start very suddenly and are moderate to severe. Its not a dangerous condition, but the symptoms last for months and can greatly disrupt your life and routine activities. Most cases of this condition are also difficult to treat.NDPH has two main forms, primary and secondary.Primary NDPH: Healthcare providers and experts often call this idiopathic NDPH, meaning experts cant determine why its happening.Secondary NDPH: This is when NDPH happens in connection with or because of another condition or disease, most commonly a viral illness.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWho does new daily persistent headache affect?NDPH can affect anyone but is more common in women and people assigned female at birth. It also may happen more often in children and teenagers, especially between ages 10 and 18, but its still possible at any age.How common is new daily persistent headache?Theres limited research on how common NDPH is, but the available data indicates that its rare. The best available studies, which are from Norway and Spain, indicate that it happens in 30 to 100 out of every 100,000 people.AdvertisementHow does new daily persistent headache affect my body?NDPH typically only affects your brain directly. However, when it has migraine-like features, it may cause light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, vertigo, nausea or vomiting.Symptoms and CausesWhat are the symptoms of new daily persistent headache?NDPH symptoms arent unique, but some happen in an unusual way.Theyre long lasting. A requirement for diagnosing NDPH is that you have the headache for at least three months.The pain is constant. Most experts define NDPH as having nonstop pain once it starts.You remember when it started. The International Headache Societys official guidelines, the International Classification of Headache Disorders, requires that you remember when the headache started. That means a healthcare provider will only diagnose NDPH if you can remember exactly when the headache started, including where you were and what you were doing.The pain is usually moderate to severe. People with NDPH usually have moderate pain or worse. Because the pain is also constant, this has the potential to severely disrupt a persons life and activities.Headaches that happen with NDPH can look like standard tension headaches, migraines or have features of both. Tension headache symptoms can include:Pain on both sides of your head.Pain feels like pressure or tightening in or around your head.The pain doesnt get worse depending on what youre doing.Migraine features can include:Pain on one side of your head.Pain that feels like throbbing, pulsing or pounding.Photophobia (sensitivity or pain from light).Phonophobia (sensitivity or pain from sounds).Nausea and vomiting.Vertigo.Visual auras.AdvertisementWhat causes new daily persistent headache?Experts don't know exactly why NDPH happens, but they suspect certain events and circumstances are possible triggers. Going through stressful events is a common feature for people who develop NDPH. People are also likely to develop NDPH after certain medical events, but theres not enough data to confirm if these events either cause or contribute to NDPH.One such key type of trigger is having an infection. People often develop NDPH while they have a viral or bacterial infection, including:Epstein-Barr virus (a key cause of mononucleosis, or just mono).Salmonella.E. coli.Dengue fever.COVID-19.Meningitis or encephalitis.You can also have NDPH as a secondary effect of another medical condition that directly affects your brain or central nervous system. Some examples of this include:Subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding into the subarachnoid space between your brain and an outer membrane; this often begins very suddenly with a thunderclap headache).Low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, usually from a CSF leak in your skull or around your spinal cord.High CSF pressure that causes a headache.Post-injury headache (such as from a concussion or traumatic brain injury).Medication overuse (especially for medications that treat headaches or migraines), which can cause rebound headaches.Is new daily persistent headache contagious?No, NDPH doesnt spread from one person to another. While NDPH can happen after some infections, having those infections isnt a guarantee of developing NDPH.Diagnosis and TestsHow is new daily persistent headache diagnosed?Diagnosing NDPH is a multistep process.The first step is to gather information about your symptoms, including how long youve had the headache, when it started and what youre feeling from it.The second step is to rule out other causes of the headache.The first step usually involves a healthcare provider talking to you and asking you questions. They may also do a neurological exam to check for signs of any related problems with your nervous system.After the first step is complete, the healthcare provider needs to make sure there isnt another cause for NDPH. Thats key because NDPH shares so many symptoms with other neurological conditions.Diagnosing before reaching the three-month requirementIts common for people to seek medical care before they reach the three-month requirement for having NDPH. In these cases, your provider will go through all the same diagnostic steps but wont finalize the diagnosis. In these instances, your provider will diagnose you with probable NDPH. Once you reach three months with symptoms, they can formally diagnose you with NDPH.What tests will be done to diagnose new daily persistent headache?There arent any tests that can directly diagnose NDPH. Instead, tests focus on ruling out other conditions that could cause similar symptoms, especially conditions that are dangerous or life-threatening. Some possible tests include:Computerized tomography (CT) scan.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.Lumbar puncture (spinal tap).Blood testing to look for signs of infection.Depending on your medical history or the symptoms you describe, your provider may also recommend other tests. You can talk to your provider to learn more about the tests they recommend and the reason for the recommendation. Theyre the best source of information relevant to your situation and can tailor the information to your specific circumstances.Management and TreatmentHow is new daily persistent headache treated, and is there a cure?NDPH is often a difficult condition to treat. Some cases of this condition are easier to treat, especially those with migraine-like symptoms. Tension headache cases are more likely to resist treatment. Time is also a factor, as NDPH is more likely to respond to treatment when treated earlier rather than years after symptoms begin.Medications are usually the main way to treat NDPH. However, finding a medication that can treat this condition is often difficult. Some examples of possible medication types include:Antidepressants. Medications like amitriptyline, nortriptyline and venlafaxine, which also treat pain disorders, can sometimes help NDPH.Antiseizure medications. Some examples include gabapentin or topiramate.Botulinum toxin injections (commonly known by the brand name Botox®). This drug blocks nerve signals, including pain signals. Other types of nerve blocks can also help.Medications used to prevent migraines. Examples include beta-blockers like propranolol and angiotensin-II receptor blockers like candesartan.Experimental anesthetic/antidepressants. Ketamine, a powerful anesthetic that also sees experimental use in treating resistant depression, can sometimes help NDPH.Complications or side effects of the treatmentsThe possible complications and side effects that can happen with the treatments depend on many factors, especially the specific medication. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the side effects and complications that are most likely for you, and what you can do to prevent them or minimize their effects.How do I take care of myself or manage the symptoms?Treating NDPH yourself is difficult, especially when you dont have a diagnosis. Thats because this condition often wont respond to standard headache treatments. That means over-the-counter medications, and even many prescription medications, arent effective at stopping NDPH.You also shouldnt try to self-diagnose or self-treat NDPH because a moderate or severe headache that starts suddenly is also a key symptom of a stroke. Strokes happen because of blood clots or other blockages in your brain, cutting off blood flow. The longer you wait to get medical care after symptoms start, the less likely that the symptoms are reversible. Eventually, a stroke causes permanent brain damage or even death.If you or someone youre with has this symptom, especially with other stroke symptoms, you should immediately call 911 (or your local emergency services number).IMPORTANT: To recognize the symptoms of a stroke, remember to think FAST:F is for face. Ask the person to smile. Look for a droop on one or both sides of their face, which is a sign of paralysis (facial hemiplegia) or muscle weakness.A is for arm: A person having a stroke often has muscle weakness or paralysis on one side. Ask them to raise their arms. If they have new one-sided weakness or paralysis, one arm will stay higher while the other will sag and drop downward, or wont raise up at all.S is for speech. Strokes often cause a person to lose their ability to speak. They might slur their speech or have trouble choosing the right words.T is for time. Time is critical, so dont wait to get help! If possible, look at your watch or a clock and remember when symptoms start. Telling a healthcare provider about when the symptoms started can help the provider know what treatment options are best for you.How soon after treatment will I feel better?Unfortunately, theres no way to know whether or not different treatments will work. Its common for many medications to have no effect on NDPH. In general, it takes about six to eight weeks for a preventive treatment plan to take effect. Your healthcare provider is the best person to talk to you about how fast a medication  if effective  should work. They can tell you what you can and should expect, and what you should do if treatment isnt effective.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentPreventionHow can I reduce my risk of developing new daily persistent headache, and is it preventable?Unfortunately, NDPH happens unpredictably. That means theres no way to prevent it. Many of the possible triggers also happen unpredictably, so theres also no way to effectively reduce your risk.Outlook / PrognosisWhat can I expect if I have new daily persistent headache?If you have NDPH, you should expect a headache with moderate to severe pain. This headache lasts for at least three months, and the pain occurs every day and doesnt stop. Some people do get relief from treatment, but many dont.How long new daily persistent headache lastsFor some people, NDPH is something theyll experience for years before it eventually goes away. The headache usually stops within three years for people who fall into this category. In others, the headache never goes away. When people have NDPH that doesnt respond to treatment and doesnt stop on its own, this condition can be so disruptive that it interferes with their ability to work, participate in social activities and more. Learning to live with this condition also can involve providers from multiple specialties, such as a mental health provider to treat the psychological effects of living with chronic pain.Outlook for new daily persistent headacheOn its own, NDPH isnt a dangerous condition. However, living with moderate or severe chronic pain is known to affect a persons mental and emotional well-being negatively. People with chronic pain conditions commonly also develop or have mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.Multiple factors make this condition difficult to diagnose. These include:This condition is rare.There arent any diagnostic tests that can definitively confirm it.Imaging tests usually dont show any changes that could explain the symptoms.Because of all the above factors, people with NDPH may need to see multiple healthcare providers before they get a diagnosis. As this is a condition that providers can only truly diagnose after a person has symptoms for at least three months (though they can diagnose it as a probable case before that), people with NDPH often live with the symptoms without a definite answer on whats causing their condition. That can further contribute to mental health concerns like anxiety and depression.Living WithHow do I take care of myself?If you have NDPH, a healthcare provider can offer suggestions on what you can do to try to help this condition. For the most part, theres not much that most people can do to manage this condition. However, theres some evidence that focusing on your general health and well-being can improve the odds that certain treatments  especially medications  will work. In general, the health behaviors that seem most beneficial include:Eat a healthy diet.Get regular physical activity.Have a regular sleep schedule and get enough sleep.When should I see a healthcare provider?In general, you should see a healthcare provider if you dont have a history of headaches and develop a new, moderately painful headache that meets any of the following criteria:It doesnt get better with over-the-counter medications and/or it gets continually worse.It happens on only one side of your head or involves throbbing, pounding or pulsing pain.You have other symptoms like severe nausea and vomiting, or sensitivity to light and sound.The above criteria arent just signs of NDPH, but can also happen with several other severe headache disorders or health conditions. These usually happen with serious conditions that a healthcare provider should examine to see if you have a concern that needs medical care.When should I go to ER?Severe headaches that happen suddenly, dont get better or worsen over time are also potential signs of severe or dangerous conditions. There are also other symptoms that indicate you need to get medical care immediately. These include:Weakness, numbness or tingling on one or both sides of your body.Loss of vision or disruptions in your vision, like blurred vision, double vision, etc.Confusion or feeling very tired.Trouble with balance or speaking.Additional Common QuestionsIs new daily persistent headache different from migraines, cluster headaches or other headache disorders?Yes, NDPH is different from other headache disorders. NDPH can share some features with migraines and other headache disorders, but is different enough that experts classify it on its own.Does new daily persistent headache ever go away?NDPH goes away for some people, but not for all. However, theres no way to predict when this will happen or to whom.When should I be concerned about recurring headaches?You should be concerned about recurring headaches that are moderately painful or worse, or that dont get better with treatment or go away on their own. If you have headaches every day, its a good idea to talk to a primary care provider. While its common to have daily headaches for mostly harmless reasons, like needing eyeglasses or contacts, you can also have them for other, more serious reasons.Is it normal to have a slight headache every day?No, its not normal to have a headache every day. If you have daily headaches, its a good idea to talk to a healthcare provider. They can determine if you have a serious condition thats causing your headaches or if you need to see a specialist for further care. In many cases, a provider can rule out serious conditions and help you find ways to stop headaches from happening or treat them when they do.A note from Cleveland ClinicNew daily persistent headache (NDPH) is a rare condition where a person develops a new headache thats moderately painful or worse and doesnt get better over time. This condition is difficult to treat, and many people with it have pain and other symptoms for years. Sometimes, the headache goes away on its own, but this happens unpredictably. Healthcare providers can suggest treatment options, but more research is necessary before experts can say why this condition happens and what means are most effective in treating it.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 08/31/2022.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

CausesBy Mayo Clinic Staff
Your headache symptoms can help your doctor determine its cause and the appropriate treatment. Most headaches aren't the result of a serious illness, but some may result from a life-threatening condition requiring emergency care.
Headaches are generally classified by cause:
Primary headaches
A primary headache is caused by overactivity of or problems with pain-sensitive structures in your head. A primary headache isn't a symptom of an underlying disease.
Chemical activity in your brain, the nerves or blood vessels surrounding your skull, or the muscles of your head and neck (or some combination of these factors) can play a role in primary headaches. Some people may also carry genes that make them more likely to develop such headaches.The most common primary headaches are:Cluster headache Migraine Migraine with aura Tension headache Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC), such as cluster headache and paroxysmal hemicraniaA few headache patterns also are generally considered types of primary headache, but are less common. These headaches have distinct features, such as an unusual duration or pain associated with a certain activity.
Although generally considered primary, each could be a symptom of an underlying disease. They include:Chronic daily headaches (for example, chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, or hemicranias continua)Cough headaches Exercise headaches Sex headaches Some primary headaches can be triggered by lifestyle factors, including:Alcohol, particularly red wineCertain foods, such as processed meats that contain nitratesChanges in sleep or lack of sleepPoor postureSkipped mealsStressSecondary headachesA secondary headache is a symptom of a disease that can activate the pain-sensitive nerves of the head. Any number of conditions  varying greatly in severity  may cause secondary headaches.
Possible causes of secondary headaches include:Acute sinusitis Arterial tears (carotid or vertebral dissections)Blood clot (venous thrombosis) within the brain  separate from strokeBrain aneurysm Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation) Brain tumor Carbon monoxide poisoning Chiari malformation (structural problem at the base of your skull)Concussion Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Dehydration (when the body doesn't have enough water and other fluids to work as it should)Dental problemsEar infection (middle ear) Encephalitis (brain inflammation)Giant cell arteritis (inflammation of the lining of the arteries)Glaucoma (acute angle closure glaucoma)Hangovers High blood pressure (hypertension) Influenza (flu) and other febrile (fever) illnessesIntracranial hematoma Medications to treat other disordersMeningitis Monosodium glutamate (MSG)Overuse of pain medicationPanic attacks and panic disorder Persistent post-concussive symptoms (Post-concussion syndrome) Pressure from tight headgear, such as a helmet or gogglesPseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) Stroke Toxoplasmosis Trigeminal neuralgia (as well as other neuralgias, all involving irritation of certain nerves connecting the face and brain)Some types of secondary headaches include:Ice cream headaches (commonly called brain freeze)Medication overuse headaches (caused by overuse of pain medication)Sinus headaches (caused by inflammation and congestion in sinus cavities)Spinal headaches (caused by low pressure or volume of cerebrospinal fluid, possibly the result of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak, spinal tap or spinal anesthesia)Thunderclap headaches (a group of disorders that involves sudden, severe headaches with multiple causes)

Headache: When to worry, what to do
Understanding what causes headaches and finding treatments to relieve the pain.

Nearly everyone has had headache pain, and most of us have had it many times. A minor headache is little more than a nuisance that's relieved by an over-the-counter pain reliever, some food or coffee, or a short rest. But if your headache is severe or unusual, you might worry about stroke, a tumor, or a blood clot. Fortunately, such problems are rare. Still, you should know when a headache needs urgent care and how to control the vast majority of headaches that are not threatening to your health.
What causes headaches?
Doctors don't fully understand what causes most headaches. They do know that the brain tissue and the skull are never responsible since they don't have nerves that register pain. But the blood vessels in the head and neck can signal pain, as can the tissues that surround the brain and some major nerves that originate in the brain. The scalp, sinuses, teeth, and muscles and joints of the neck can also cause head pain.
When to worry about a headache
You can take care of many types of headaches by yourself, and your doctor can give you medication to control most of the tougher headaches. But some headaches call for prompt medical care. Here are some warning signs for when you should worry about headaches:
headaches that first develop after age 50
a major change in the pattern of your headaches
an unusually severe headache
head pain that increases with coughing or movement
headaches that get steadily worse
changes in personality or mental function
headaches that are accompanied by fever, stiff neck, confusion, decreased alertness or memory, or neurological symptoms such as visual disturbances, slurred speech, weakness, numbness, or seizures
headaches that are accompanied by a painful red eye
headaches that are accompanied by pain and tenderness near the temples
headaches after a blow to the head
headaches that prevent normal daily activities
headaches that come on abruptly, especially if they wake you up
headaches in patients with cancer or impaired immune systems.
Types of headaches
There are more than 300 types of headaches, but only about 10% of headaches have a known cause. The others are called primary headaches. Here is a rundown on some major primary headaches.
Tension headaches
Occurring in about three of every four adults, tension headaches are the most common of all headaches. In most cases, they are mild to moderate in severity and occur infrequently. But a few people get severe tension headaches, and some are troubled by them for three or four times a week.
The typical tension headache produces a dull, squeezing pain on both sides of the head. People with strong tension headaches may feel like their head is in a vise. The shoulders and neck can also ache. Some tension headaches are triggered by fatigue, emotional stress, or problems involving the muscles or joints of the neck or jaw. Most last for 20 minutes to two hours.
If you get occasional tension-type headaches, you can take care of them yourself. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, other brands) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, naproxen (Aleve, other brands), or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, other brands) often do the trick, but follow the directions on the label, and never take more than you should. A heating pad or warm shower may help; some people feel better with a short nap or light snack.
If you get frequent tension-type headaches, try to identify triggers so you can avoid them. Don't get overtired or skip meals. Learn relaxation techniques; yoga is particularly helpful because it can relax both your mind and your neck muscles. If you clench your jaw or grind your teeth at night, a bite plate may help.
If you need more help, your doctor may prescribe a stronger pain medication or a muscle relaxant to control headache pain. Many people with recurrent tension-type headaches can prevent attacks by taking a tricyclic antidepressant such as amitriptyline (Elavil, generic). Fortunately, most people with tension-type headaches will do very well with simpler programs.
Migraine
Migraines occur less often than tension headaches, but they are usually much more severe. They are two to three times more common in women than men, but that's small consolation if you are among the minority of men who have migraines. And since a Harvard study of 20,084 men age 40 to 84 reported that having migraines boosts the risk of heart attacks by 42%, men with migraines should take their headaches to heart.
Neurologists believe that migraines are caused by changes in the brain's blood flow and nerve cell activity. Genetics play a role since 70% of migraine victims have at least one close relative with the problem.
Migraine triggers. Although a migraine can come on without warning, it is often set off by a trigger. The things that set off a migraine vary from person to person, but a migraine sufferer usually remains sensitive to the same triggers. The table lists some of the most common ones.
Major migraine triggers
Changing weather: rising humidity, heat
Lack of sleep or oversleeping
Fatigue
Emotional stress
Sensory triggers: bright or flickering lights, loud noises, strong smells
Dietary triggers:
missing a mealalcohol, especially red winechocolatenitrates in cured meats and fishaged cheesean increase or decrease in caffeineMSG (often present in Asian and prepared foods)
Migraine symptoms. About 20% of migraines begin with one or more neurological symptoms called an aura. Visual complaints are most common. They may include halos, sparkles or flashing lights, wavy lines, and even temporary loss of vision. The aura may also produce numbness or tingling on one side of the body, especially the face or hand. Some patients develop aura symptoms without getting headaches; they often think they are having a stroke, not a migraine.
The majority of migraines develop without an aura. In typical cases, the pain is on one side of the head, often beginning around the eye and temple before spreading to the back of the head. The pain is frequently severe and is described as throbbing or pulsating. Nausea is common, and many migraine patients have a watering eye, a running nose, or congestion. If these symptoms are prominent, they may lead to a misdiagnosis of sinus headaches. One way to remember the features of migraine is to use the word POUND
P is for pulsating pain
O for one-day duration of severe untreated attacks
U for unilateral (one-sided) pain
N for nausea and vomiting
D for disabling intensity.
Without effective treatment, migraine attacks usually last for four to 24 hours. When you're suffering a migraine, even four hours is far too long  and that's why early treatment for a migraine is so important.
Migraine treatment. If you spot a migraine in its very earliest stages, you may be able to control it with nonprescription pain relievers. Acetaminophen, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and a combination of pain medications and caffeine are all effective  if you take a full dose very early in the attack.
When prescription drugs are needed, most doctors turn to the triptans, which are available as tablets, nasal sprays, or as injections that patients can learn to give to themselves. Examples include sumatriptan (Imitrex), zolmitriptan (Zomig), and rizatriptan (Maxalt). Triptans provide complete relief within two hours for up to 70% of patients; the response is best if treatment is started early. Some patients require a second dose within 12 to 24 hours. Patients with cardiovascular disease and those who take a high dose of certain antidepressants need to discuss the risks of using them with their doctor.
Work with your doctor to find the migraine treatment that works best for you. Remember, though, that overuse can lead to rebound headaches and a vicious cycle of drugs and headaches. So, if you need treatment more than two or three times a week, consider preventive medications.
Migraine prevention. Some people can prevent migraines simply by avoiding triggers. Others do well with prompt therapy for occasional attacks. But patients who suffer frequent migraine attacks often benefit from preventive medications. Effective prescription drugs include beta blockers (such as propranolol, nadolol and atenolol), certain antidepressants (such as amitriptyline), and certain antiseizure medications (such topiramate). Difficult cases may benefit from referral to a headache specialist.
Cluster headaches
Cluster headaches are uncommon but very severe headaches, and they occur five times more often in men than women. Although anyone can get cluster headaches, the typical patient is a middle-aged man with a history of smoking.
The problem gets its name because the headaches tend to come in clusters, with one to eight headaches a day during a one- to three-month period every year or two, often at the same time of year. The pain always strikes one side of the head and is very severe. The eye on the painful side is red and watery, the eyelid may droop, and the nose runs or is blocked. The attack starts abruptly and lasts for 30 to 60 minutes. Most sufferers become restless and agitated during the attack; unable to sit still, they pace, jog in place, or beat their head against a wall. Nausea and sensitivity to light and sound may accompany the pain.
Inhaling high flow oxygen soon after the onset of the headache can often stop the attack. Sumatriptan is often effective for cluster headaches, particularly when given by injection. Other triptans may also help. Some patients favor lidocaine nose drops, dihydroergotamine injections, or other treatments. The most effective medication for preventing cluster headache attacks is verapamil, a calcium-channel blocker.
Other types of headaches
Doctors have diagnosed hundreds of conditions associated with headaches. Here are just a few:
Medication headaches. Many drugs number headaches among their side effects. And although it seems paradoxical, many medications used to treat headaches can also cause medication overuse headaches or rebound headaches. Migraine sufferers are particularly vulnerable to a vicious cycle of pain leading to more medication, which triggers more pain. If you have frequent headaches and use medication, OTC or prescription, or both, for more than 10 to 15 days a month, you may have medication overuse headaches. The way to find out is to discontinue or taper your medication  but always consult your doctor first. A corticosteroid such as prednisone may help control pain during the withdrawal period.
Sinus headaches. Acute sinusitis causes pain over the forehead, around the nose and eyes, over the cheeks, or in the upper teeth. Stooping forward increases the pain. Thick nasal discharge, congestion, and fever pinpoint the problem to the sinuses. When the acute infection resolves, the pain disappears. Sinusitis is not a common cause of chronic or recurrent headaches.
Ice cream headaches. Some people develop sharp, sudden headache pain when they eat anything cold. The pain is over in less than a minute, even if you keep eating. If you are bothered by ice cream headaches, try eating slowly and warming the cold food at the front of your mouth before you swallow it.
Headache from high blood pressure. Except in cases of very high blood pressure, hypertension does not cause headaches. In fact, most people with high blood pressure don't have any symptoms.
Headache from exercise and sex. Sudden, strenuous exercise can bring on a headache. Gradual warm-ups or treatment with an anti-inflammatory medication before exercise can help. Sexual intercourse may also trigger headaches; some men note only dull pain, but others suffer from severe attacks called orgasmic headaches. Some people can prevent orgasmic headaches by taking an NSAID 30 to 60 minutes before intercourse.
Headache testing
Modern medicine depends on tests to diagnose many problems. For most headaches, though, a good old-fashioned history and physical will do the job. In fact, CT scans, MRIs, and EEGs (brain wave tests) look normal in tension-type headaches, migraines, and cluster headaches. Still, these tests can be vital in patients with warning signs or other worrisome headaches.
Living with constant headaches
For most of us, an occasional headache is nothing more than a temporary speed bump in the course of a busy day. Even so, most people can ease the problem with simple lifestyle measures and nonprescription medications. Relaxation techniques, biofeedback, yoga, and acupuncture may also help. But for some of us, headaches are a big problem. Learn to recognize warning signs that call for prompt medical care. Work with your doctor to develop a program to prevent and treat migraines and other serious headaches. And don't fall into the trap of overusing medications; for some gents, rebound headaches are the biggest pain of all.

Medical News TodayHealth ConditionsHealth ProductsDiscoverToolsConnectSubscribeWhen is a headache a cause for concern?Medically reviewed by Deena Kuruvilla, MD  Written by Rachel Nall, MSN, CRNA and Karen Veazey 
Updated on November 28, 2023'Red flag' symptomsIn adultsIn pregnancyIn childrenDiagnosisSummaryHeadaches are often treatable at home and not a cause of worry, but some need urgent medical attention. For instance, a sudden, severe, thunderclap-type headache can be a sign of a stroke. Among those who seek treatment at an emergency department, around 0.54.5% do so for a headache that is not related to trauma, according to the journal PLOS ONE. This article looks at the different causes and symptoms of potentially dangerous headaches. It also looks at when a person should seek medical help.Red flag symptomsShare on PinterestMasha Raymers/Getty ImagesThe following are some symptoms that indicate a person should seek immediate medical treatment related to their headache:a severe headache that becomes unbearable within seconds to minutesa headache that starts or changes intensity when changing positiona headache that begins when a person coughs, sneezes, or strains themselvesa headache that does not go awaya headache that develops after 50 years of agea headache that occurs with symptoms including fever, chills, night sweats, and unexpected weight lossa headache that begins despite the person having no history of headache or migraine a significant increase in the frequency of headaches or a change in the headaches characteristicsa constant headache that always occurs in the same locationassociated neurological symptoms, such as changes in vision, numbness or weakness on one side of the body, or speech changesaccompanying red and painful eyeIf a person experiences any of these symptoms, they should seek medical help immediately. A person should also seek immediate medical help if they experience:an altered mental statefacial drooping or an inability to move one side of the bodyseizuresa severe headache and they have a history of immunosuppression due to a medical condition such as HIV or cancerthe sudden onset of severe, unbearable pain visual disturbances unrelated to migraineIf a person experiences any of these symptoms, they should call 911 for emergency medical attention. They should not attempt to drive themselves to the emergency room.A headache can indicate a number of emergency medical conditions. However, this is not typically the only symptom a person experiences. The following are symptoms, considerations, and treatment options for emergency headache conditions. In adultsThe following sections describe some emergency-related reasons a person may need to seek medical attention for a headache. Heat exhaustion and heatstrokeA person experiences heat exhaustion as a result of the excessive loss of salt and water. This normally occurs due to excessive sweating.Symptoms include:headachedizzinessnauseairritabilityweaknessthirstraised body temperaturedecreased output of urineheavy sweatingThe United Kingdoms National Health Service (NHS) notes that if a person cools down within 30 minutes, heat exhaustion is not serious. However, it can develop into heatstroke, which is a medical emergency.Heatstroke occurs when the body is no longer able to regulate its temperature. When a person experiences heatstroke, their temperature may rise quickly, within 1015 minutes, to extreme levels. It can be fatal if untreated.Symptoms of heatstroke include:confusion, slurred speechaltered mental statehot, dry skinprofuse sweatingseizurevery high body temperatureTreatmentIf a person notices someone nearby is exhibiting the symptoms of heatstroke, they should immediately call 911 for intervention. They should then move the person to a shady, cooler area and take off outer layers of clothes. If a person is experiencing heat exhaustion, they should:move to a cool placelie down and slightly raise their feetdrink plenty of waterFor both heat exhaustion and heatstroke, a person should spray the skin or sponge it using cool water.They could use a fan to circulate air to help aid cooling. Cold, wet cloths or ice on the head, armpits, or groin can help with cooling. Brain tumor A brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells grow and divide in the brain. Because the skull does not allow for significant brain expansion, the tumors presence can cause a number of symptoms, including headaches. Headaches may represent the brain tumors growth. Some people also experience seizures. In addition to headaches, the most common brain tumor symptoms in people going to the emergency room are:seizuresan altered mental statevisual changesnauseavomitingdizziness or fallsThe specific symptoms may vary based on the location of the tumor. TreatmentTreatment depends on the location of the tumor and whether or not it has spread. Options may include surgical removal, or radiation or chemotherapy to shrink the tumor.Learn more about the different types of brain tumors and the treatment options available here.Carbon monoxide poisoningCarbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that occurs when a person burns fuel in an automobile, stove, small engine, lantern, grill, fireplace, gas range cooker, or furnace. An estimated 20,000 people per year visit the emergency room due to carbon monoxide exposure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Carbon monoxide has a greater attraction to cells than oxygen in the bloodstream. As a result, carbon monoxide molecules can replace oxygen, which may ultimately lead to suffocation and death.Additional symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include:dizzinessweaknessnauseavomitingconfusionchest painSome people who are sleeping or have been drinking alcohol may not experience symptoms, which can increase the fatality risk of carbon monoxide exposure. TreatmentAfter exposure to carbon monoxide, a person should get to fresh air as quickly as possible and call 911. Healthcare professionals will treat carbon monoxide poisoning using oxygen and a medication called methylene blue, which they administer through an intravenous (IV) line.Carotid artery dissection Around 68% of people with carotid artery dissection will experience headaches, according to a case study in the journal BMJ Case Reports. The condition occurs when there is a tear in the layers of one of the carotid arteries that supply blood to the brain. As a result, blood can pool within the layers of the artery.A carotid artery dissection can lead to stroke, brain damage, and death. The headache that develops due to carotid artery dissection typically only affects one side of the head, according to a case study in BMJ Case Reports. A person may also experience neck pain, speech changes, and a slight drooping of one eye. TreatmentTreatment will depend on the symptoms and where in the carotid artery the dissection has occurred. Options typically include:taking blood-thinning medicationsundergoing endovascular treatmentundergoing surgeryLearn more about carotid arteries here.Concussion A concussion is a brain injury that occurs due to a blow or jolt to the head. The movement affects the brains positioning in the skull and can lead to brain cell damage.If a person does not receive treatment, this can lead to brain damage, seizures, and death.A headache or neck pain are common symptoms of concussion. Other symptoms include:nausea or vomitingringing in the earsdizzinesstirednessconvulsionsconfusionweakness, numbness, or decreased coordinationsensitivity to noise or lightslurred speechfaintingTreatmentTreatment includes resting and limiting physical activity to allow the brain to heal. Treating the symptoms is also vital. For example, a primary care doctor or a neurologist should treat a headache early, and a psychiatrist should treat any feelings of depression or anxiety as soon as possible.If a person has a hematoma, or a collection of blood outside of a blood vessel, they may require surgery to evacuate or reduce it. Hypertensive crisisA hypertensive crisis occurs when a persons systolic blood pressure is higher than 180 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or their diastolic blood pressure is higher than 120 mm Hg, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). If a person does not receive prompt treatment, a hypertensive crisis can cause life-threatening conditions such as stroke, heart attack, pulmonary edema, or an aortic dissection. A headache is a common symptom when a person has high blood pressure, according to a long-term study in the American Journal of Hypertension. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nosebleeds, and profound anxiety. TreatmentA doctor may admit a person experiencing a hypertensive emergency to the hospital. Treatments include medications such as beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzymes. Learn more about managing hypertension here.MeningitisMeningitis is an infection of the outer layers of the brain. It can develop due to a previous infection in the inner ear, sinuses, or another area of the body. Untreated meningitis can lead to sepsis, which is a severe infection in the body that causes the organs to shut down. As well as a headache, symptoms of meningitis include:fevera stiff necknauseavomitingsensitivity to lightTreatmentDoctors will typically treat meningitis using antibiotics. StrokeThere are two main types of stroke  ischemic and hemorrhagic. An ischemic stroke can occur when a blood clot lodges in a vessel in the brain. A hemorrhagic stroke can occur due to bleeding in the brain.If a doctor cannot treat the stroke promptly, a person can develop significant disabilities or die. Anyone experiencing a stroke needs immediate medical attention.Some additional symptoms include:facial droopingchanges in the persons mental stateweakness on one side of the bodynumbness on one side of the bodyvomitingspeech changesTreatmentTreatment depends on the type of stroke. Options include taking medications to break up a clot and surgery to remove a clot or repair a damaged blood vessel. Learn more about the treatments for stroke here.In pregnancyPeople should not ignore headaches during pregnancy as they might indicate a potentially serious condition that could affect their own or their babys health.These conditions include the following: PreeclampsiaThis is a condition that causes high blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg after 20 weeks of pregnancy. It can also cause swelling and proteinuria, or the presence of protein in the urine, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Preeclampsia can progress to eclampsia, which is a life-threatening condition. It can also lead to a condition called HELLP syndrome. HELLP stands for hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet counts. A person can also experience preeclampsia in the immediate postpartum period. Learn more about preeclampsia after birth here.As well as a headache, some symptoms include:high blood pressurevision changespain in the upper abdomennauseavomitingTreatmentIf a pregnancy is at 37 weeks or later, a doctor may recommend delivering the baby. Pregnancies that are not as far along may require frequent monitoring, bed rest, blood pressure treatments, and medications to help speed up fetal lung development and aid earlier delivery.Eclampsia Eclampsia is a severe form of pregnancy hypertension that can result in seizures or a coma. It can be life-threatening to both the pregnant person and the fetus. It can also lead to HELLP syndrome. Besides a headache, symptoms may include:high blood pressureseizuresa comanauseavomitingsensitivity to lightTreatmentImmediate intervention is needed to prevent life-threatening complications. Examples include administering magnesium sulfate via an IV line to reduce the risk of seizures, and taking medications to lower blood pressure. Doctors may also make every effort to deliver the baby. In the immediate postpartum period, a person can also experience a severe headache known as a postdural puncture headache (PDPH) if they had an epidural or spinal anesthesia for pain management.According to a 2017 article, however, around 85% of PDPH cases resolve by themselves with conservative treatment, including:caffeine consumptionbed restanalgesic medicationsA doctor may also offer a blood patch as a treatment.Headache and migraine resourcesTo discover more evidence-based information and resources for headaches and migraine, visit our dedicated hub.In children Children can also experience severe headaches that may indicate a medical emergency. These include:ConcussionAccording to the CDC, toddlers and infants may show different concussion symptoms than adults. As well as a headache, these can include refusing to nurse or eat, persistent crying, and an inability to be consoled.A 2017 article says people should not give aspirin to anyone younger than 16 years due to increased risks of bleeding and a condition known as Reyes syndrome. MeningitisSymptoms of meningitis in babies and newborns include headaches, inactivity, irritability, difficulty feeding, or vomiting. Sometimes their head may appear to bulge through the soft spot.DiagnosisA doctor will seek to determine whether the headache is primary or secondary. A primary headache is not a symptom of another condition. Secondary headaches are symptoms of other, underlying conditions. A headache diary may help determine the triggers for primary headaches, such as food or activities.A healthcare professional will take a full medical history when examining a person for headaches. They will also ask questions about the frequency, severity, and location of the headaches themselves.Diagnostic tools such as imaging may help the doctor determine the source of headache pain. Some options are:erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), a blood test that indicates inflammationMRI scanCT scandigital subtraction angiography, which uses X-ray and iodine to map blood vessels in the brainspinal tap, which can determine if infection is present or if there is bleeding in the brainSummaryAlthough usually harmless, a headache might indicate an emergency situation.If a person is unsure whether or not their headache is a symptom of a serious or life-threatening condition, they should seek emergency medical attention. A doctor can evaluate their condition and recommend treatments to reduce their headache and address any underlying causes.

CausesBy Mayo Clinic Staff
Your headache symptoms can help your doctor determine its cause and the appropriate treatment. Most headaches aren't the result of a serious illness, but some may result from a life-threatening condition requiring emergency care.
Headaches are generally classified by cause:
Primary headaches
A primary headache is caused by overactivity of or problems with pain-sensitive structures in your head. A primary headache isn't a symptom of an underlying disease.
Chemical activity in your brain, the nerves or blood vessels surrounding your skull, or the muscles of your head and neck (or some combination of these factors) can play a role in primary headaches. Some people may also carry genes that make them more likely to develop such headaches.The most common primary headaches are:Cluster headache Migraine Migraine with aura Tension headache Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC), such as cluster headache and paroxysmal hemicraniaA few headache patterns also are generally considered types of primary headache, but are less common. These headaches have distinct features, such as an unusual duration or pain associated with a certain activity.
Although generally considered primary, each could be a symptom of an underlying disease. They include:Chronic daily headaches (for example, chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, or hemicranias continua)Cough headaches Exercise headaches Sex headaches Some primary headaches can be triggered by lifestyle factors, including:Alcohol, particularly red wineCertain foods, such as processed meats that contain nitratesChanges in sleep or lack of sleepPoor postureSkipped mealsStressSecondary headachesA secondary headache is a symptom of a disease that can activate the pain-sensitive nerves of the head. Any number of conditions  varying greatly in severity  may cause secondary headaches.
Possible causes of secondary headaches include:Acute sinusitis Arterial tears (carotid or vertebral dissections)Blood clot (venous thrombosis) within the brain  separate from strokeBrain aneurysm Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation) Brain tumor Carbon monoxide poisoning Chiari malformation (structural problem at the base of your skull)Concussion Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Dehydration (when the body doesn't have enough water and other fluids to work as it should)Dental problemsEar infection (middle ear) Encephalitis (brain inflammation)Giant cell arteritis (inflammation of the lining of the arteries)Glaucoma (acute angle closure glaucoma)Hangovers High blood pressure (hypertension) Influenza (flu) and other febrile (fever) illnessesIntracranial hematoma Medications to treat other disordersMeningitis Monosodium glutamate (MSG)Overuse of pain medicationPanic attacks and panic disorder Persistent post-concussive symptoms (Post-concussion syndrome) Pressure from tight headgear, such as a helmet or gogglesPseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) Stroke Toxoplasmosis Trigeminal neuralgia (as well as other neuralgias, all involving irritation of certain nerves connecting the face and brain)Some types of secondary headaches include:Ice cream headaches (commonly called brain freeze)Medication overuse headaches (caused by overuse of pain medication)Sinus headaches (caused by inflammation and congestion in sinus cavities)Spinal headaches (caused by low pressure or volume of cerebrospinal fluid, possibly the result of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak, spinal tap or spinal anesthesia)Thunderclap headaches (a group of disorders that involves sudden, severe headaches with multiple causes)
Causes shown here are commonly associated with this symptom. Work with your doctor or other health care professional for an accurate diagnosis.

A headache is one of the most common reasons for attending a doctor's surgery or a neurology clinic.In this article:What is a headache?Types of headacheWhat causes headaches?How to get rid of a headacheWhat types of headaches are serious?When to worry about a headacheHow to prevent a headacheSummaryWhat is a headache?A headache is a pain or throbbing in the head or face. Almost everyone will experience headaches at some time. Most headaches are not caused by serious or sinister conditions.People understandably worry if their headache symptoms seem different - either particularly severe, more frequent or unusual in any other way. The most common worry is that the headache is a symptom of a brain tumour.This leaflet discusses headache generally. It explains the different types of headache experienced and describes those very rare situations where a headache can be a symptom of serious disease.Patient picks for HeadacheBrain and nervesHome remedy relief for common headachesHow do you get rid of a headache naturally? In many cases, the solution lies in preventing headaches before they start. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to reduce the likelihood of headaches.by

RawBrain and nervesIdiopathic intracranial hypertensionIn idiopathic intracranial hypertension there is raised pressure within the skull (raised intracranial pressure), which puts pressure on the brain. Idiopathic means that the cause of this raised pressure is unknown. The main symptoms are headache and loss of sight (visual loss). It mostly affects women of childbearing age who are overweight or obese. Treatment is aimed at preventing permanent visual loss and includes treatment with medicines. Brain surgery (neurosurgery) may also be used. For many people, a combination of medical and surgical treatment can help to control their symptoms well.by Dr Doug
McKechnie, MRCGPTypes of headacheHeadaches can be primary, or they can be secondary headaches which means they are a side-effect of a separate illness or injury.Very occasionally, headaches need further investigation to rule out more serious underlying causes. The most common types of headache, by a very long way, are tension headaches and migraines.Types of headaches include:Tension headachesTension headaches are the most common type of headache and are usually felt as a band or pressure across the forehead. They can last for several days. They can be uncomfortable and tiring but they do not usually disturb sleep.Most people can carry on working with a tension headache. They tend to worsen as the day progresses and are not usually made worse by physical activity, although it's not unusual to be a bit sensitive to bright light or noise. See the separate leaflet called Tension Headache.MigrainesMigraine headaches are also very common. A typical migraine is one-sided and throbbing, usually above or behind one eye. Headaches that are one-sided, headaches that cause throbbing pain and headaches that cause nausea are more likely to be migraines than anything else.Migraines are often severe enough to be disabling. Some patients need to go to bed to sleep off their headache. They very often cause extreme sensitivity to light and sound. See the separate leaflet called Migraine.Cluster headachesCluster headaches are very severe headaches, sometimes called 'suicide headaches'. They occur in clusters, often every day for a number of days or even weeks. They then disappear for months on end. They are uncommon and tend to occur particularly in adult male smokers.They are one-sided headaches which are really very disabling (they prevent regular activity). People often describe them as the worst pain they have ever felt.Patients often have a red watery eye on the affected side, a stuffy runny nose and a droopy eyelid. See the separate leaflet called Cluster Headaches.Chronic tension headachesChronic tension headache (or chronic daily headache) is usually caused by muscle tension in the back of the neck and affects women more often than men. Chronic means that the condition is persistent and ongoing.These headaches can be started by neck strain (for example, sitting awkwardly at a computer for hours per day) or tiredness and may be made worse by medication overuse (see below). When headaches occur almost every day for three months or more, this is called a chronic daily headache. See the separate leaflet called Chronic Tension Headache.Medication-overuse headachesMedication-overuse headache (medication-induced headache or 'rebound headache') is an unpleasant and long-lasting headache. It is caused by taking painkilling medication - usually for headache.Unfortunately, when painkillers are taken regularly for headaches, the body responds by making more pain sensors (in the nerve cells) in the head. Eventually there are so many pain sensors that the head is extremely sensitive and the headache won't go away.People who have these headaches often take more and more painkillers to try to feel better. However, the painkillers have often long ceased to work.Medication-overuse headaches are the most common cause of secondary headache. These headaches can be treated but require stopping of the painkillers which can be difficult in the short-term. Read more in the separate leaflet on Medication-overuse Headache (Medication-induced Headache).Thunderclap headachesThunderclap headaches start very suddenly and are very painful. Pain reaches a maximum within about one minute; the headache lasts at least five minutes but sometimes much longer. It is important to seek medical attention immediately because thunderclap headaches are often caused by a serious underlying health condition, such as a subarachnoid haemorrhage.Exertional headaches/sexual headachesExertional headaches are headaches associated with physical activity. They can become severe very quickly after a strenuous activity such as running, coughing, having sex (intercourse)or straining with bowel movements. They are more commonly experienced by patients who also have migraines or who have relatives with migraine.Headaches related to sex particularly worry patients. They can occur as sex begins, at orgasm, or after sex is over. Headaches at orgasm are the most common type. They tend to be severe, at the back of the head, behind the eyes or all over. They last about twenty minutes and are not usually a sign of any other problems.Exertional and sexual intercourse-related headaches are not usually a sign of serious underlying problems. Very occasionally they can be a sign that there is a leaky blood vessel on the surface of the brain so if they are marked and repeated, it is sensible to seek medical help.Primary stabbing headachesPrimary stabbing headaches are sometimes called 'ice-pick headaches' or 'idiopathic stabbing headache'. The term 'idiopathic' is used by doctors for something that comes without a clear cause. These are short, stabbing headaches which are very sudden and severe. They usually last between 5 and 30 seconds, at any time of the day or night. They feel as if a sharp object (like an ice pick) is being stuck into the head.They often occur in or just behind the ear and they can be quite frightening. Although they are not migraines they are more common in people who have migraines - almost half of people who experience migraines have primary stabbing headaches. They are often felt in the place on the head where the migraines tend to occur.Primary stabbing headaches are too short to treat although migraine prevention medications may reduce their frequency.Hemicrania continuaHemicrania continua is a primary chronic daily headache. It typically causes a continuous but fluctuating head pain on one side. The pain is usually continuous with episodes of more severe pain, which can last between 20 minutes and several days.During these episodes of severe pain there may be other symptoms such as watering or redness of the eye, runny or blocked nose, and drooping of the eyelid, all on the same side as the headache. Similar to migraine, there may also be sensitivity to light, feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting).The headaches do not go away on their own but there may be periods without the headache. However, hemicrania continua headaches respond well to a medicine called indometacin.Trigeminal neuralgiaTrigeminal neuralgia causes facial pain. The pain consists of extremely short bursts of electric shock-like sensation in the face - in the area of the eyes, nose, scalp, forehead, jaws and/or lips. It is usually one-sided and is more common in people over the age of 50. It can be triggered by touch or a light breeze on the face but can come on without any trigger. See the separate leaflet called Trigeminal Neuralgia.Continue reading belowWhat causes headaches?Sometimes headaches have underlying causes and treatment of the headache involves treating the cause. People often worry that headaches are caused by serious disease or by high blood pressure. Both of these are very uncommon causes of headache; high blood pressure usually causes no symptoms at all.Chemicals, drugs and substance withdrawalHeadaches can be due to a substance, or its withdrawal, Some examples are:Carbon monoxide (which is produced by gas heaters which are not properly ventilated).Drinking alcohol (with headache often experienced the morning after).Lack of body fluid (dehydration).Caffeine (people often develop headaches if they have reduced the amount of caffeine they drink; this resolves over a few days as the body gets used to the reduced caffeine).Headaches due to referred painSome headaches can be caused by pain in some other part of the head, such as tooth, ear , jaw or neck.Sinusitis is a common cause. The sinuses are 'holes' in the skull which are there to stop it from being too heavy for the neck to carry around. They are lined with mucous membranes, like the lining of the nose, and this produces mucus in response to colds or allergy. The lining membranes also swell up and may block the drainage of the mucus from the space. It then becomes thickened and infected, leading to headache.The headache of sinusitis is often felt at the front of the head and also in the face or teeth. Often the face feels tender to pressure, particularly just below the eyes and beside the nose. There may be an associated stuffy nose and the pain is often worse on bending forwards. Acute sinusitis is the type that comes on quickly in association with a cold or sudden allergy. It is sometimes accompanied by a temperature and the production of a lot of mucus.Chronic sinusitis can be caused by allergy, by overusing decongestants or by an acute sinusitis that doesn't settle. The sinuses become chronically infected and the sinus linings chronically swollen. The contents of the sinuses may be thick but often not infected.Acute glaucoma can cause severe headache. In this condition the pressure inside one of the eyes goes up suddenly and this causes a sudden, very severe headache behind the eye. The eyeball can feel very hard to touch, the eye is red, the front of the eye (cornea) can look cloudy and the vision is usually blurred. The pupil often looks fixed and does not respond to light. This is a medical emergency and immediate medical attention should be sought.How to get rid of a headacheThere are a number of ways to try to prevent headaches or to help get rid of a headache. No one method works for everyone or every headache so it is sensible to experiment with different options.Drinking enough fluids but avoiding or limiting alcohol.Getting enough sleep and avoiding screen time (TV, computers, etc) before going to bed.Drinking a small amount of caffeine.Applying a cold pack to the eyes or head.Having a warm bath or shower.Staying in a darkened, quiet room.Trying methods to help relaxation, such as mindfulness, breathing exercises, lavender oil, meditation or yoga.Trying acupressure, acupuncture, massage, or osteopathic or chiropractic treatments.Taking simple pain relief, such as paracetamol, ibuprofen or aspirin. (Aspirin cannot be taken by children under the age of 18.)Continue reading belowWhat types of headaches are serious?All headaches are unpleasant and some, such as headache from medication misuse, are serious in the sense that when not tackled properly they may be very difficult and troublesome to treat. However, a few headaches are signs of serious underlying problems. These are uncommon - in many cases very rare.Dangerous headaches tend to occur suddenly, and to become progressively worse over time. They are more common in older people. They include the following:Bleeding around the brain (subarachnoid haemorrhage)Subarachnoid haemorrhage is a very serious condition which occurs when a small blood vessel bursts on the surface of the brain. People develop a severe headache and stiff neck and may become unconscious. This is a rare cause of severe headache.Meningitis and brain infectionsMeningitis is infection of the tissues around and on the surface of the brain and encephalitis is infection of the brain itself. Brain infections can be caused by germs called bacteria, viruses or fungi and they are thankfully rare. They can cause a severe, disabling headache.Usually people are sick (vomit) and cannot bear bright light (this is called photophobia). Often they have a stiff neck, too stiff for the doctor to be able to bend the head down so that the chin touches the chest (even if trying to relax). People with meningitis or encephalitis are usually also unwell - hot, sweaty and ill.Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis)Giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) is usually only seen in people over the age of 50. It is caused by swelling (inflammation) of the arteries in the temples and behind the eye. It causes a headache behind the forehead (a frontal headache).Typically the arteries in the forehead are tender and people notice pain in the scalp when they comb their hair. Often the pain gets worse with chewing. Temporal arteritis is serious because if it is not treated it can cause sudden loss of eyesight.Treatment is with a course of steroids. The need to continue these steroids is usually monitored by the GP surgery and they are typically needed for many months.Brain tumoursBrain tumour is a very uncommon cause of headaches - although most patients with long-lasting, severe or persistent headaches start to worry that this may be the cause.Usually the headache of brain tumours is present on waking in the morning, is worse on sitting up, and gets steadily worse from day to day, never easing and never disappearing. It can sometimes be worse on coughing and sneezing (as can sinus headaches and migraines).When do I need to seek medical advice about a headache?Dr Sarah Jarvis MBE, FRCGPWhen to worry about a headacheMost headaches don't have a serious underlying cause.The things which would suggest to a clinician that a headache might need further investigation include the following. They do not mean that the headache is serious or sinister but they mean that the clinician might wish to do some further checks to be sure:There has been a significant head injury in the previous three months.The headaches are worsening and accompanied by high temperature (fever).The headache started extremely suddenly.Problems with speech and balance have developed along with the headache.There are problems with memory or changes in behaviour or personality as well as headache.The headaches are accompanied by confusion or feeling muddled.The headache started on coughing, sneezing or straining.The headache is worse when you sit or stand.The headache is associated with red or painful eyes.The headaches are not like anything experienced before.There is unexplained vomiting with the headache.There is reduced immunity - for example, if in someone with HIV, or who is on oral steroid medication or immune suppressing drugs.The person has or has had a cancer that can spread through the body.How to prevent a headacheManage stress levels well.Eat a balanced, regular diet.Take balanced regular exercise.Pay attention to posture and core muscles.Sleep on two pillows or fewer.Drink plenty of water.Have plenty of sleep.Any of these should improve health and well-being and reduce the number of headaches.SummaryMost headaches, whilst unpleasant, are harmless and respond to simple measures. Migraine, tension headache and medication-overuse headache are all very common. Most of the population will experience one or more of these. Working out the underlying cause of any headaches is often the best way to solve them.Most headaches go away by themselves. It is very rare for them to be a sign of a serious or sinister underlying condition.Medical advice should be sought for a headache that is unusual or headaches which are particularly severe or stop regular activities, those which are associated with other symptoms like weakness or tingling, and those which cause a sore scalp (especially over 50 years of age).Finally, seek medical attention for a morning headache which is present for several days, which does not go away or is getting gradually worse.Dr Mary Lowth is an author or the original author of this leaflet.Further reading and referencesPrakash S, Patel P; Hemicrania continua: clinical review, diagnosis and management.

Medical News TodayHealth ConditionsHealth ProductsDiscoverToolsConnectSubscribeWhen is a headache a cause for concern?Medically reviewed by Deena Kuruvilla, MD  Written by Rachel Nall, MSN, CRNA and Karen Veazey 
Updated on November 28, 2023'Red flag' symptomsIn adultsIn pregnancyIn childrenDiagnosisSummaryHeadaches are often treatable at home and not a cause of worry, but some need urgent medical attention. For instance, a sudden, severe, thunderclap-type headache can be a sign of a stroke. Among those who seek treatment at an emergency department, around 0.54.5% do so for a headache that is not related to trauma, according to the journal PLOS ONE. This article looks at the different causes and symptoms of potentially dangerous headaches. It also looks at when a person should seek medical help.Red flag symptomsShare on PinterestMasha Raymers/Getty ImagesThe following are some symptoms that indicate a person should seek immediate medical treatment related to their headache:a severe headache that becomes unbearable within seconds to minutesa headache that starts or changes intensity when changing positiona headache that begins when a person coughs, sneezes, or strains themselvesa headache that does not go awaya headache that develops after 50 years of agea headache that occurs with symptoms including fever, chills, night sweats, and unexpected weight lossa headache that begins despite the person having no history of headache or migraine a significant increase in the frequency of headaches or a change in the headaches characteristicsa constant headache that always occurs in the same locationassociated neurological symptoms, such as changes in vision, numbness or weakness on one side of the body, or speech changesaccompanying red and painful eyeIf a person experiences any of these symptoms, they should seek medical help immediately. A person should also seek immediate medical help if they experience:an altered mental statefacial drooping or an inability to move one side of the bodyseizuresa severe headache and they have a history of immunosuppression due to a medical condition such as HIV or cancerthe sudden onset of severe, unbearable pain visual disturbances unrelated to migraineIf a person experiences any of these symptoms, they should call 911 for emergency medical attention. They should not attempt to drive themselves to the emergency room.A headache can indicate a number of emergency medical conditions. However, this is not typically the only symptom a person experiences. The following are symptoms, considerations, and treatment options for emergency headache conditions. In adultsThe following sections describe some emergency-related reasons a person may need to seek medical attention for a headache. Heat exhaustion and heatstrokeA person experiences heat exhaustion as a result of the excessive loss of salt and water. This normally occurs due to excessive sweating.Symptoms include:headachedizzinessnauseairritabilityweaknessthirstraised body temperaturedecreased output of urineheavy sweatingThe United Kingdoms National Health Service (NHS) notes that if a person cools down within 30 minutes, heat exhaustion is not serious. However, it can develop into heatstroke, which is a medical emergency.Heatstroke occurs when the body is no longer able to regulate its temperature. When a person experiences heatstroke, their temperature may rise quickly, within 1015 minutes, to extreme levels. It can be fatal if untreated.Symptoms of heatstroke include:confusion, slurred speechaltered mental statehot, dry skinprofuse sweatingseizurevery high body temperatureTreatmentIf a person notices someone nearby is exhibiting the symptoms of heatstroke, they should immediately call 911 for intervention. They should then move the person to a shady, cooler area and take off outer layers of clothes. If a person is experiencing heat exhaustion, they should:move to a cool placelie down and slightly raise their feetdrink plenty of waterFor both heat exhaustion and heatstroke, a person should spray the skin or sponge it using cool water.They could use a fan to circulate air to help aid cooling. Cold, wet cloths or ice on the head, armpits, or groin can help with cooling. Brain tumor A brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells grow and divide in the brain. Because the skull does not allow for significant brain expansion, the tumors presence can cause a number of symptoms, including headaches. Headaches may represent the brain tumors growth. Some people also experience seizures. In addition to headaches, the most common brain tumor symptoms in people going to the emergency room are:seizuresan altered mental statevisual changesnauseavomitingdizziness or fallsThe specific symptoms may vary based on the location of the tumor. TreatmentTreatment depends on the location of the tumor and whether or not it has spread. Options may include surgical removal, or radiation or chemotherapy to shrink the tumor.Learn more about the different types of brain tumors and the treatment options available here.Carbon monoxide poisoningCarbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that occurs when a person burns fuel in an automobile, stove, small engine, lantern, grill, fireplace, gas range cooker, or furnace. An estimated 20,000 people per year visit the emergency room due to carbon monoxide exposure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Carbon monoxide has a greater attraction to cells than oxygen in the bloodstream. As a result, carbon monoxide molecules can replace oxygen, which may ultimately lead to suffocation and death.Additional symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include:dizzinessweaknessnauseavomitingconfusionchest painSome people who are sleeping or have been drinking alcohol may not experience symptoms, which can increase the fatality risk of carbon monoxide exposure. TreatmentAfter exposure to carbon monoxide, a person should get to fresh air as quickly as possible and call 911. Healthcare professionals will treat carbon monoxide poisoning using oxygen and a medication called methylene blue, which they administer through an intravenous (IV) line.Carotid artery dissection Around 68% of people with carotid artery dissection will experience headaches, according to a case study in the journal BMJ Case Reports. The condition occurs when there is a tear in the layers of one of the carotid arteries that supply blood to the brain. As a result, blood can pool within the layers of the artery.A carotid artery dissection can lead to stroke, brain damage, and death. The headache that develops due to carotid artery dissection typically only affects one side of the head, according to a case study in BMJ Case Reports. A person may also experience neck pain, speech changes, and a slight drooping of one eye. TreatmentTreatment will depend on the symptoms and where in the carotid artery the dissection has occurred. Options typically include:taking blood-thinning medicationsundergoing endovascular treatmentundergoing surgeryLearn more about carotid arteries here.Concussion A concussion is a brain injury that occurs due to a blow or jolt to the head. The movement affects the brains positioning in the skull and can lead to brain cell damage.If a person does not receive treatment, this can lead to brain damage, seizures, and death.A headache or neck pain are common symptoms of concussion. Other symptoms include:nausea or vomitingringing in the earsdizzinesstirednessconvulsionsconfusionweakness, numbness, or decreased coordinationsensitivity to noise or lightslurred speechfaintingTreatmentTreatment includes resting and limiting physical activity to allow the brain to heal. Treating the symptoms is also vital. For example, a primary care doctor or a neurologist should treat a headache early, and a psychiatrist should treat any feelings of depression or anxiety as soon as possible.If a person has a hematoma, or a collection of blood outside of a blood vessel, they may require surgery to evacuate or reduce it. Hypertensive crisisA hypertensive crisis occurs when a persons systolic blood pressure is higher than 180 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or their diastolic blood pressure is higher than 120 mm Hg, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). If a person does not receive prompt treatment, a hypertensive crisis can cause life-threatening conditions such as stroke, heart attack, pulmonary edema, or an aortic dissection. A headache is a common symptom when a person has high blood pressure, according to a long-term study in the American Journal of Hypertension. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nosebleeds, and profound anxiety. TreatmentA doctor may admit a person experiencing a hypertensive emergency to the hospital. Treatments include medications such as beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzymes. Learn more about managing hypertension here.MeningitisMeningitis is an infection of the outer layers of the brain. It can develop due to a previous infection in the inner ear, sinuses, or another area of the body. Untreated meningitis can lead to sepsis, which is a severe infection in the body that causes the organs to shut down. As well as a headache, symptoms of meningitis include:fevera stiff necknauseavomitingsensitivity to lightTreatmentDoctors will typically treat meningitis using antibiotics. StrokeThere are two main types of stroke  ischemic and hemorrhagic. An ischemic stroke can occur when a blood clot lodges in a vessel in the brain. A hemorrhagic stroke can occur due to bleeding in the brain.If a doctor cannot treat the stroke promptly, a person can develop significant disabilities or die. Anyone experiencing a stroke needs immediate medical attention.Some additional symptoms include:facial droopingchanges in the persons mental stateweakness on one side of the bodynumbness on one side of the bodyvomitingspeech changesTreatmentTreatment depends on the type of stroke. Options include taking medications to break up a clot and surgery to remove a clot or repair a damaged blood vessel. Learn more about the treatments for stroke here.In pregnancyPeople should not ignore headaches during pregnancy as they might indicate a potentially serious condition that could affect their own or their babys health.These conditions include the following: PreeclampsiaThis is a condition that causes high blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg after 20 weeks of pregnancy. It can also cause swelling and proteinuria, or the presence of protein in the urine, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Preeclampsia can progress to eclampsia, which is a life-threatening condition. It can also lead to a condition called HELLP syndrome. HELLP stands for hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet counts. A person can also experience preeclampsia in the immediate postpartum period. Learn more about preeclampsia after birth here.As well as a headache, some symptoms include:high blood pressurevision changespain in the upper abdomennauseavomitingTreatmentIf a pregnancy is at 37 weeks or later, a doctor may recommend delivering the baby. Pregnancies that are not as far along may require frequent monitoring, bed rest, blood pressure treatments, and medications to help speed up fetal lung development and aid earlier delivery.Eclampsia Eclampsia is a severe form of pregnancy hypertension that can result in seizures or a coma. It can be life-threatening to both the pregnant person and the fetus. It can also lead to HELLP syndrome. Besides a headache, symptoms may include:high blood pressureseizuresa comanauseavomitingsensitivity to lightTreatmentImmediate intervention is needed to prevent life-threatening complications. Examples include administering magnesium sulfate via an IV line to reduce the risk of seizures, and taking medications to lower blood pressure. Doctors may also make every effort to deliver the baby. In the immediate postpartum period, a person can also experience a severe headache known as a postdural puncture headache (PDPH) if they had an epidural or spinal anesthesia for pain management.According to a 2017 article, however, around 85% of PDPH cases resolve by themselves with conservative treatment, including:caffeine consumptionbed restanalgesic medicationsA doctor may also offer a blood patch as a treatment.Headache and migraine resourcesTo discover more evidence-based information and resources for headaches and migraine, visit our dedicated hub.In children Children can also experience severe headaches that may indicate a medical emergency. These include:ConcussionAccording to the CDC, toddlers and infants may show different concussion symptoms than adults. As well as a headache, these can include refusing to nurse or eat, persistent crying, and an inability to be consoled.A 2017 article says people should not give aspirin to anyone younger than 16 years due to increased risks of bleeding and a condition known as Reyes syndrome. MeningitisSymptoms of meningitis in babies and newborns include headaches, inactivity, irritability, difficulty feeding, or vomiting. Sometimes their head may appear to bulge through the soft spot.DiagnosisA doctor will seek to determine whether the headache is primary or secondary. A primary headache is not a symptom of another condition. Secondary headaches are symptoms of other, underlying conditions. A headache diary may help determine the triggers for primary headaches, such as food or activities.A healthcare professional will take a full medical history when examining a person for headaches. They will also ask questions about the frequency, severity, and location of the headaches themselves.Diagnostic tools such as imaging may help the doctor determine the source of headache pain. Some options are:erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), a blood test that indicates inflammationMRI scanCT scandigital subtraction angiography, which uses X-ray and iodine to map blood vessels in the brainspinal tap, which can determine if infection is present or if there is bleeding in the brainSummaryAlthough usually harmless, a headache might indicate an emergency situation.If a person is unsure whether or not their headache is a symptom of a serious or life-threatening condition, they should seek emergency medical attention. A doctor can evaluate their condition and recommend treatments to reduce their headache and address any underlying causes.

The main symptom of a headache is pain in your head or face. There are several types of headaches, and tension headaches are the most common. While most headaches arent dangerous, certain types can be a sign of a serious underlying condition.ContentsArrow DownOverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionOutlook / PrognosisLiving WithContentsArrow DownOverviewSymptoms and CausesDiagnosis and TestsManagement and TreatmentPreventionOutlook / PrognosisLiving WithOverviewLifestyle factors that can trigger primary headaches include consuming alcohol, consuming nicotine, changes in sleep, poor posture and more.What is a headache?A headache is a pain in your head or face thats often described as a pressure thats throbbing, constant, sharp or dull. Headaches can differ greatly in regard to pain type, severity, location and frequency.Headaches are a very common condition that most people will experience many times during their lives. Theyre the most common form of pain and are a major reason cited for days missed at work or school, as well as visits to healthcare providers.While most headaches arent dangerous, certain types can be a sign of a more serious condition.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat are the types of headaches?There are more than 150 types of headaches. They fall into two main categories: primary and secondary headaches.Primary headachesDysfunction or over-activity of pain-sensitive features in your head cause primary headaches. Theyre not a symptom of or caused by an underlying medical condition. Some people may have genes that make them more likely to develop primary headaches.Types of primary headaches include:Tension-type headaches (most common type of headache).Migraine headaches.Cluster headaches.New daily persistent headaches (NDPH).Some primary headaches can be triggered by lifestyle factors or situations, including:Alcohol, particularly red wine.Certain foods, such as processed meats that contain nitrates (food-triggered headaches).Consuming nicotine (nicotine headache).Changes in sleep or lack of sleep.Poor posture.Physical activity, such as exercise (exertion headaches).Skipped meals (hunger headache).Coughing, sneezing, blowing your nose, straining (such as when having a bowel movement), or laughing or crying vigorously (cough headaches).Primary headaches typically arent dangerous, but they can be very painful and disrupt your day-to-day life.Secondary headachesAn underlying medical condition causes secondary headaches. Theyre considered a symptom or sign of a condition.Types of secondary headaches that arent necessarily dangerous and resolve once the underlying condition is treated include:Dehydration headache.Sinus headaches.Medication overuse headaches.Types of secondary headaches that can be a sign of a serious or potentially life-threatening condition include:Spinal headaches: Spinal headaches are intense headaches that occur when spinal fluid leaks out of the membrane covering your spinal cord, usually after a spinal tap. Most spinal headaches can be treated at home, but prolonged, untreated spinal headaches can cause life-threatening complications, including subdural hematoma and seizures.Thunderclap headaches: A thunderclap headache is an extremely painful headache that comes on suddenly, like a clap of thunder. This type of headache reaches its most intense pain within one minute and lasts at least five minutes. While thunderclap headaches can sometimes be harmless, its important to seek immediate medical attention. They can be a sign of:Head injury.Brain bleed.Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.A sudden, severe rise in blood pressure.Whats the difference between a headache and a migraine?A migraine is a type of primary headache disorder.A migraine is a common neurological condition that causes a variety of symptoms, most notably a throbbing headache on one side of your head. Migraines often get worse with physical activity, lights, sounds or smells. They usually last at least four hours or even days.AdvertisementWho do headaches affect?Anyone can have a headache, including children, adolescents and adults. About 96% of people experience a headache at least once in their life.About 40% of people across the world have tension-type headaches and about 10% have migraine headaches.Symptoms and CausesWhat is the main cause of a headache?Headache pain results from signals interacting among your brain, blood vessels and surrounding nerves. During a headache, multiple mechanisms activate specific nerves that affect muscles and blood vessels. These nerves send pain signals to your brain, causing a headache.AdvertisementAre headaches hereditary?Headaches tend to run in families, especially migraines. Children who have migraines usually have at least one biological parent who also experiences them. In fact, kids whose parents have migraines are up to four times more likely to develop them.Headaches can also be triggered by environmental factors shared in a familys household, such as:Eating certain foods or ingredients, like caffeine, alcohol, fermented foods, chocolate and cheese.Exposure to allergens.Secondhand smoke.Strong odors from household chemicals or perfumes.What headache symptoms require immediate medical care?If you or your child has any of these headache symptoms, get medical care right away:A sudden, new and severe headache.Headache with a fever, shortness of breath, stiff neck or rash.Headaches that occur after a head injury or accident.Getting a new type of headache after age 55.Also seek medical care right away if your headache is associated with neurological symptoms, such as:Weakness.Dizziness.Sudden loss of balance or falling.Numbness or tingling.Paralysis.Speech difficulties.Mental confusion.Seizures.Personality changes/inappropriate behavior.Vision changes (blurry vision, double vision or blind spots).Diagnosis and TestsHow are headaches evaluated and diagnosed?If you have headaches often or if theyre very severe, reach out to your healthcare provider.Its important to diagnose headaches correctly so your provider can prescribe specific therapy to help you feel better. Your provider will complete a physical examination, discuss your medical history and talk to you about your headache symptoms. This conversation is part of a headache evaluation.During the headache evaluation, your provider will ask you about your headache history, including:What the headaches feel like.How often the headaches happen.How long the headaches last each time.How much pain the headaches cause you.What foods, drinks or events trigger your headaches.How much caffeine you drink each day.What your stress level is.What your sleep habits are like.Your headache can be more accurately diagnosed by knowing:When the headache started.Whether theres a single type of headache or multiple types of headaches.If physical activity aggravates the headache pain.Who else in your family has headaches.What symptoms, if any, occur between headaches.After completing the medical history part of the evaluation, your provider may perform physical and neurological examinations. Theyll look for signs and symptoms of an illness or condition that may be causing the headache, including:Fever.Infection.High blood pressure.Muscle weakness, numbness or tingling.Excessive fatigue.Loss of consciousness.Balance problems and frequent falls.Vision problems (blurry vision, double vision, blind spots).Mental confusion or personality changes.Seizures.Dizziness.Nausea and vomiting.Neurological tests focus on ruling out diseases that might also cause headaches. A disorder of your central nervous system might be suspected in the development of serious headaches.After evaluating the results of your headache history, physical examination and neurological examination, your physician should be able to determine what type of headache you have, whether or not a serious problem is present and whether additional tests are needed.If theyre unsure of the cause, they may refer you to a headache specialist.What tests will be done to diagnose headaches?Although scans and other imagining tests can be important when ruling out other diseases, they dont help in diagnosing migraines, cluster or tension-type headaches.But if your healthcare provider thinks that your headaches are being caused by another medical condition, there are several imaging tests they may order.A CT scan or MRI can help determine if your headaches are connected to an issue with your central nervous system. Both of these tests produce cross-sectional images of your brain that can show any abnormal areas or problems.Management and TreatmentHow is a headache treated?Treatment for headaches depends on the type.One of the most crucial aspects of treating primary headaches is figuring out your triggers. Learning what those are  typically by keeping a headache log  can reduce the number of headaches you have.Once you know your triggers, your healthcare provider can tailor treatment to you. For example, you may get headaches when youre tense or worried. Counseling and stress management techniques can help you handle this trigger better. By lowering your stress level, you can avoid stress-induced headaches.Not every headache requires medication. A range of treatments is available. Depending on your headache type, frequency and cause, treatment options include:Stress management.Biofeedback.Medications.Treating the underlying medical condition/cause.Stress management for headacheStress management teaches you ways to cope with stressful situations. Relaxation techniques help manage stress. You use deep breathing, muscle relaxation, mental images and music to ease your tension.Biofeedback for headacheBiofeedback teaches you to recognize when tension is building in your body. You learn how your body responds to stressful situations and ways to settle it down. During biofeedback, sensors are connected to your body. They monitor your involuntary physical responses to headaches, which include increases in:Breathing rate.Pulse.Heart rate.Temperature.Muscle tension.Brain activity.Medications for headacheOccasional tension headaches usually respond well to over-the-counter pain relievers. But be aware that using these medications too often can lead to long-term daily headaches (medication overuse headaches).For frequent or severe headaches, your provider may recommend prescription headache medications. Triptans and other types of drugs can stop a migraine attack. You take them at the first signs of an oncoming headache.Drugs for high blood pressure, seizures and depression can sometimes prevent migraines. Your healthcare provider may recommend trying one of these medications to reduce headache frequency.Treating the underlying medical condition causing secondary headacheTreatment for secondary headaches involves treating the underlying medical condition causing it.For example, surgery is often needed to correct the underlying cause of secondary cough headache.How can I get rid of a headache?You can treat the occasional, mild headache at home with over-the-counter pain relievers. Other self-care treatments for headaches include:Applying heat or cold packs to your head.Doing stretching exercises.Massaging your head, neck or back.Resting in a dark and quiet room.Taking a walk.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentPreventionHow can I prevent headaches?The key to preventing headaches is figuring out what triggers them. Triggers are very specific to each person  what gives you a headache may not be a problem for others. Once you determine your triggers, you can avoid or minimize them.For example, you may find that strong scents set you off. Avoiding perfumes and scented products can make a big difference in how many headaches you have. The same goes for other common triggers like troublesome foods, lack of sleep and poor posture.Many people, however, arent able to avoid triggers or are unable to identify triggers. In that case, a more personalized multidisciplinary approach with a headache specialist is often necessary.Outlook / PrognosisCan headaches or migraines be cured?Treating health problems that cause headaches, such as high blood pressure, can eliminate head pain. Recently, there have been several new advancements in our understanding of what causes headaches.Although researchers are closer than ever before to a cure, at this time, there isnt a cure for primary headaches. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing future episodes.Living WithWhen should I see my healthcare provider about headaches?Contact your healthcare provider if you or your child has any of the following symptoms or situations:Experiencing one or more headaches per week.Experiencing headaches that keep getting worse and wont go away.Needing to take a pain reliever every day or almost every day for your headaches.Needing more than two to three doses of over-the-counter medications per week to relieve headache symptoms.Experiencing headaches that are triggered by exertion, coughing, bending or strenuous activity.Having a history of headaches but experiencing a recent change in your headache symptoms.A note from Cleveland ClinicIf your headaches are interfering with your daily functioning or affecting your mood, its important to talk to your healthcare provider. If possible, try to write down how you feel when youre experiencing a headache. Keeping a journal of your headaches and how they make you feel can be helpful when youre talking to your provider.The information you give your healthcare provider about your headaches is the most important part of the diagnosis process. By giving your provider as much information as possible about your headaches, youre more likely to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan that will help you feel better.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 08/29/2022.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

CausesBy Mayo Clinic Staff
Your headache symptoms can help your doctor determine its cause and the appropriate treatment. Most headaches aren't the result of a serious illness, but some may result from a life-threatening condition requiring emergency care.
Headaches are generally classified by cause:
Primary headaches
A primary headache is caused by overactivity of or problems with pain-sensitive structures in your head. A primary headache isn't a symptom of an underlying disease.
Chemical activity in your brain, the nerves or blood vessels surrounding your skull, or the muscles of your head and neck (or some combination of these factors) can play a role in primary headaches. Some people may also carry genes that make them more likely to develop such headaches.The most common primary headaches are:Cluster headache Migraine Migraine with aura Tension headache Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC), such as cluster headache and paroxysmal hemicraniaA few headache patterns also are generally considered types of primary headache, but are less common. These headaches have distinct features, such as an unusual duration or pain associated with a certain activity.
Although generally considered primary, each could be a symptom of an underlying disease. They include:Chronic daily headaches (for example, chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, or hemicranias continua)Cough headaches Exercise headaches Sex headaches Some primary headaches can be triggered by lifestyle factors, including:Alcohol, particularly red wineCertain foods, such as processed meats that contain nitratesChanges in sleep or lack of sleepPoor postureSkipped mealsStressSecondary headachesA secondary headache is a symptom of a disease that can activate the pain-sensitive nerves of the head. Any number of conditions  varying greatly in severity  may cause secondary headaches.
Possible causes of secondary headaches include:Acute sinusitis Arterial tears (carotid or vertebral dissections)Blood clot (venous thrombosis) within the brain  separate from strokeBrain aneurysm Brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation) Brain tumor Carbon monoxide poisoning Chiari malformation (structural problem at the base of your skull)Concussion Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Dehydration (when the body doesn't have enough water and other fluids to work as it should)Dental problemsEar infection (middle ear) Encephalitis (brain inflammation)Giant cell arteritis (inflammation of the lining of the arteries)Glaucoma (acute angle closure glaucoma)Hangovers High blood pressure (hypertension) Influenza (flu) and other febrile (fever) illnessesIntracranial hematoma Medications to treat other disordersMeningitis Monosodium glutamate (MSG)Overuse of pain medicationPanic attacks and panic disorder Persistent post-concussive symptoms (Post-concussion syndrome) Pressure from tight headgear, such as a helmet or gogglesPseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension) Stroke Toxoplasmosis Trigeminal neuralgia (as well as other neuralgias, all involving irritation of certain nerves connecting the face and brain)Some types of secondary headaches include:Ice cream headaches (commonly called brain freeze)Medication overuse headaches (caused by overuse of pain medication)Sinus headaches (caused by inflammation and congestion in sinus cavities)Spinal headaches (caused by low pressure or volume of cerebrospinal fluid, possibly the result of spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak, spinal tap or spinal anesthesia)Thunderclap headaches (a group of disorders that involves sudden, severe headaches with multiple causes)
Causes shown here are commonly associated with this symptom. Work with your doctor or other health care professional for an accurate diagnosis.

on April 24, 2020CausesTreatmentPreventionBabies and childrenSeeing a doctorSummaryHeadache and fever can occur due to a variety of medical conditions. Sometimes people may experience a headache and a fever together. Possible causes include infections, vaccinations, medication, and more.Sometimes, having a headache and a fever at the same time can be serious, so people experiencing both may wish to consult a doctor for a diagnosis.Some people may also have concerns about whether they have contracted SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as both of these symptoms have an association with COVID-19. However, several other conditions can cause a headache and fever together. Keep reading to learn more about the different causes and treatments for headache and fever, including some prevention tips. Coronavirus resourcesFor more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.CausesShare on PinterestFever and headache are both symptoms of meningitis.The following are some potential causes of a fever and headache:Meningitis Meningitis is a bacterial or viral infection that causes inflammation of the meninges, which are membranes that surround the brain. If the meninges become inflamed, a person can develop a headache. Meningitis can be life-threatening. Other symptoms of meningitis often include: a fevera headacheneck pain or stiffnesslight-sensitivity dizzinessconfusionnausea and vomitingFluThe seasonal flu occurs between October and March in the Northern Hemisphere and between April and August in the Southern Hemisphere. Influenza viruses travel from person to person through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and talking. When a person catches the flu, they may experience the following symptoms: a fevera headachea cougha sore throatmuscle aches and painsa runny nosecongested eyeslight sensitivityshortness of breathSinus infectionSinus infections are one of the most common infections treated in doctors offices. People with acute sinusitis typically experience a sudden or gradual onset of symptoms lasting less than 4 weeks. People with chronic sinusitis may experience symptoms for 3 or more months. The symptoms of sinus infections include:a headachea feverfacial pain and pressurenasal congestionexcessive fatiguebad breathdental paina coughEar infectionWhen the fluid within the middle ear becomes infected, a person may develop an ear infection. Ear infections are the second most common reason that children visit the pediatrician. Most ear infections occur in children between 6 and 24 months. Bacteria or viruses can cause ear infections. Pain is one of the most common symptoms, but some babies and young children may experience non-specific symptoms, including: a fevera headachedisturbed sleeppoor feedingirritabilityvomitingdiarrheaHeatstrokeHeatstroke typically occurs when a persons body temperature rises above 40°C (104°F) after prolonged exposure to heat. People may also develop heatstroke by physical overexertion in high temperatures. Neurological symptoms, such as seizures and confusion, typically accompany heatstroke. Heatstroke is a serious condition that can be life-threatening if left untreated. Anyone who experiences any symptoms of heatstroke must seek medical attention immediately.Heatstroke can develop progressively. Sometimes, a person may not notice the symptoms of heat-related illnesses developing, as they can appear very similar. However, the illness may progress from heat exhaustion, heat injury, to life-threatening heatstroke. Symptoms may include:a headachecrampingfatiguedizzinessnauseavomiting Once the heat-related illness affects the organs or central nervous system, the person has likely progressed to heatstroke. VaccinationsAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Humans Services, some people may experience mild side effects soon after getting vaccinated. These may include:a headachea mild feverchillsfatiguepain, swelling, and redness on the affected areamuscle achesjoint achesThese side effects are likely to disappear quickly without medical intervention or medication. MedicationsSome people may experience flu-like symptoms when starting a new medication. Flu-like symptoms may include:a fevera headachechillsmuscle achesa coughsore throatrunny nosefatiguenauseavomitingdiarrhea Some anticancer medications, such as interferon and interleukin, can cause flu-like symptoms. Other drugs that may cause flu-like symptoms include the tuberculosis medications rifapentine and isoniazid. Flu-like symptoms may last for a few hours or a few days. Cancer Cancer has many different symptoms, but not everyone will experience all of them. Sometimes cancer can occur without any symptoms at all. Some signs and symptoms of cancer may include:pain, including a headachea feverunexplained weight lossfatigueskin changes a coughchanges in bowel or bladder functionpersistent sores that do not healwhite patches on the tongueunusual bleeding or dischargea lumpSpecific types of cancers may present with other symptoms. TreatmentThe treatment for headache and fever depends on its cause. Meningitis If a person has bacterial meningitis, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics. Other treatments involve supportive care to make the person feel more comfortable. Some people may require: airway management oxygenationintravenous fluidsantipyretics to control fever FluIn most situations, the flu will go away without medical intervention. Some people may wish to take medications, such as antipyretics, to reduce their fever. Antipyretics, such as acetaminophen, are also pain relievers and can help reduce headaches. People usually do not require antiviral medications. Some people may require treatment or prevention with antivirals. When an outbreak occurs in a healthcare facility, such as a long-term care facility, doctors may prescribe antivirals to all residents.Sinus infectionDoctors may recommend that people with sinus infections use humidifiers, nasal washes, and nasal decongestants to reduce symptoms. Some people, however, may require topical or oral steroids to reduce inflammation in the nasal passages.Depending on the severity of the infection, the symptoms, and a variety of other factors, doctors may prescribe antibiotics. Ear infectionsDoctors may not always prescribe antibiotics for children with ear infections. Some doctors suggest watchful waiting at first and only prescribe an antibiotic treatment if the ear infection does not resolve. To control pain and fever, doctors will likely recommend pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen. If a healthcare provider decides antibiotics are necessary, they will choose the appropriate one based on a persons allergies, the severity of the infection, the presence of other symptoms or infections, and any resistance that might be present in their area.HeatstrokeTo treat heatstroke, a medical team will check the persons airway, breathing, and circulation. They will then provide rapid cooling to prevent further damage to internal organs. In most cases, doctors will ensure the individual is hydrated. PreventionTo prevent getting sick from bacteria or viruses, doctors suggest that people practice frequent and proper handwashing. If a vaccine is available and indicated for a specific condition, doctors recommend that people should have the shot. The most effective way to treat heatstroke is prevention. Wearing appropriate clothing and rescheduling strenuous outdoor work or activities in hot and humid weather are two effective strategies to prevent heat-related illnesses. In babies and childrenEar infections are common in babies and children. Sometimes doctors may recommend watchful waiting to see if the infection goes away. Although fever and headache are common symptoms in babies and children, they may be unable to express feelings of a headache. Parents and guardians should check for other signs when a child has a fever, such as excessive fatigue, lack of appetite, vomiting, among others. Antipyretics and pain relievers may help, but parents should seek medical attention first. Babies and children may also develop meningitis, which can be life-threatening. When to see a doctor If antipyretics and pain relievers are not successful in controlling fever or headache, people need to seek medical attention. Typically, fever and headaches are temporary symptoms, so people with persistent fever and headache must also consult a doctor. Anyone with a temperature above 39.5°C (103.1°F) should strongly consider seeking medical attention or call a healthcare provider to discuss the other symptoms. Summary Headache and fever are unspecific symptoms because they have associations with a variety of conditions and diseases. They are also common side effects of many different treatments. Some people may be concerned went they develop a headache and a fever at the same time, but most often it is not due to anything serious.Anyone experiencing unexplained symptoms should speak with a doctor or other healthcare provider. When antipyretic drugs and pain relievers do not help to lower a fever or control headaches, the person should speak to a doctor who may be able to recommend a more suitable treatment.Cancer / OncologyEar, Nose, and ThroatFlu / Cold / SARSHeadache / MigraineImmune System / VaccinesHow we reviewed this article:SourcesMedical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

Headache
Is this your child's symptom?Pain or discomfort of the headThis includes the forehead to the back of the headNot caused by a head injuryCauses of Acute HeadachesViral Illnesses. Most acute headaches are part of a viral illness. Flu is a common example. These headaches may relate to the level of fever. Most often, they last a few days.Hunger Headaches. About 30&percnt; of people get a headache when they are hungry. It goes away within 30 minutes of eating something.MSG Headache. MSG is a flavor enhancer sometimes added to soups or other foods. In larger amounts, it can cause the sudden onset of a throbbing headache. Flushing of the face also occurs.Common Harmless Causes. Hard exercise, bright sunlight, blowing a wind instrument or gum chewing have been reported. So has severe coughing. "Ice cream headaches" are triggered by any icy food or drink. The worse pain is between the eyes (bridge of nose).Head Injury. Most just cause a scalp injury. This leads to a painful spot on the scalp for a few days. Severe, deeper or entire-head pain needs to be seen.Frontal Sinus Infection. Can cause a headache on the forehead just above the eyebrow. Other symptoms are nasal congestion and postnasal drip. Rare before 10 years old. Reason: the frontal sinus is not yet formed. Other sinus infections cause face pain, not headaches.Meningitis (Very Serious). A bacterial infection of the membrane that covers the spinal cord and brain. The main symptoms are a stiff neck, headache, confusion and fever. Younger children are lethargic or so irritable that they can't be consoled. If not treated early, child can suffer brain damage.Causes of Recurrent HeadachesMuscle Tension Headaches. Most common type of frequent headaches. Muscle tension headaches give a feeling of tightness around the head. The neck muscles also become sore and tight. Tension headaches can be caused by staying in one position for a long time. This can happen when reading or using a computer. Other children get tension headaches as a reaction to stress or worry. Examples of this are pressure for better grades or family arguments.Migraine Headaches. Severe, very painful headaches that keep your child from doing normal activities. They are throbbing and often occur just on one side. Symptoms have a sudden onset and offset. Vomiting or nausea is present in 80%. Lights and sound make them worse. Most children want to lie down in a dark, quiet room. Migraines most often run in the family (genetic).School Avoidance. Headaches that mainly occur in the morning on school days. They keep the child from going to school. The headaches are real and due to a low pain threshold.Rebound Headaches. Caused by overuse of pain medicines in high doses. Most often happens with OTC meds. Caffeine is present in some pain meds and may play a role. Treatment is taking pain meds at the correct dosage.Not Due to Needing Glasses (Vision Headaches). Poor vision and straining to see the blackboard causes eye pain. Sometimes, it also causes a muscle tension headache. But, getting glasses rarely solves a headache problem that doesn't also have eye pain.Pain ScaleMild: your child feels pain and tells you about it. But, the pain does not keep your child from any normal activities. School, play and sleep are not changed.Moderate: the pain keeps your child from doing some normal activities. It may wake him or her up from sleep.Severe: the pain is very bad. It keeps your child from doing all normal activities.

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm  or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs)  also known as your body's "thermostat"  monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children.

A fever is a sure sign your body is fighting off some type of infection. (Photo credit: E+/Getty Images)
A fever is when you have a brief rise in body temperature thats higher than your normal body temperature. Its also called a high temperature, hyperthermia, or pyrexia. It's usually a sign your immune system is working to fight some type of infection. Fever temperaturesNormal body temperatures are different for everyone, but they usually fall within the range of 97 to 99 degrees F. A temperature of 100.4 or higher is considered a fever, but there is no medical standard. The type of thermometer you use affects the temperature you get, as some are more accurate than others. Here's a breakdown of what's considered a fever by age and temperature: Babies age 0-2 years100.4 F (rectal, forehead, or ear temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature)Children ages 2-5 years100.4 F (rectal, forehead, or ear temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature)Children ages 5 and older100.4 F (ear temperature)100 F (oral temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature) Adults100.4 F (oral temperature)A low-grade fever is when you have a temperature that is slightly higher than normal, usually around 99.5 to 100.3 F. A low-grade fever signals that something is going on to activate your immune system.When Is Fever Dangerous?A fever can make you uncomfortable, but it's generally not cause for concern. You can often manage a fever at home, but in some cases you should call your doctor. Fever in babies: When to worryCheck in with your doctor if your baby younger than 3 months:Has a rectal temperature higher than 100.4 F. Has fever higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Has other symptoms, such as a cough or diarrhea.Call 911 or go to the ER if your baby has a seizure.Check in with your doctor if your baby 3 to 6 months old: Has a rectal or oral temperature higher than 100.4 F and is also irritable or sleepy.Has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Call your doctor or go to the ER if your baby won't stop crying and cant be consoled.  Fever in children: When to worryYou should reach out to your pediatrician if your child 6 months to 2 years:Has a fever higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Has other symptoms, such as a cough or diarrhea.If their fever comes with rash, real discomfort, irritability, low energy, headache, stiff neck, or repeated diarrhea or vomiting.Their fever is higher than 104 F, which can cause a seizure.Call 911 or go to the ER if your child has a seizure.Their fever doesnt go down after taking over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen.They've recently had vaccines.Fever in adults: When to worryCall your doctor or visit urgent care or an emergency room if:You have a temperature of 103 F or higher.Your fever doesnt go down after taking over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen.Youve been in contact with someone who has COVID-19.If you have a fever that is 102 degrees or higher, especially if you're in your first trimester of pregnancy. When to call the doctorCall 911 if you or your child have any of these symptoms:UnresponsiveWheezing or difficulty breathingBlue lipsConvulsions or seizuresSpeaking in a confused way A fever with a stiff neck or headacheTemperature higher than 105 FFever with sudden onset of rashSevere stomach pain or persistent vomitingSkin rashes, blisters, or a red streak on an arm or legA severe sore throat, swelling of the throat, or earachePain with urination (peeing), back pain, or shaking chillsA serious cough, or coughing up bloodContact your doctor if your fever lasts for more than 3 days or gets worse.Fever SymptomsA fever is a sign of an illness or infection. When you have one, you may notice these symptoms:Chills or shiveringSweatingBody achesHeadacheLethargy (feeling weak)Being irritableLoss of appetiteDehydrationRed or flushed faceBabies and children might also have:Earache (or pulling at their ears)High-pitch criesLoss of appetiteExtra thirstLow urine output (peeing less than usual)What Causes Fever?A fever can be a sign of several health conditions, which may or may not need medical treatment.The most common causes are infections such as colds and stomach bugs (gastroenteritis). Other causes include:Infections of the ear, lung, skin, throat, bladder, or kidneyHeat exhaustionViral infections like the flu or COVID-19SunburnConditions that cause inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritisSide effects of medicationsVaccines and immunizationsBlood clotsAutoimmune conditions such as lupus and inflammatory bowel disease (IBS)CancerHormone disorders such as hyperthyroidismIllegal drugs such as amphetamines and cocaineTeething in babies can cause a mild, low-grade fever (not over 101 degrees).Fever DiagnosisAlthough a fever is easy to measure with a thermometer, finding its cause can be hard. If you see your doctor, they'll do a physical exam and ask questions about your symptoms, other health conditions you have, medications you take, and if you've recently traveled to areas that have health risks. A malaria infection, for example, may cause a high fever that gets better and then comes back in cycles. Some areas of the U.S. are hot spots for infections such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Your doctor may ask if you have been around someone with COVID-19 or have any other symptoms of COVID-19.Sometimes, you may have a "fever of unknown origin." That means whatever's causing your fever isn't clear. Instead, it could be more unusual like a connective tissue disorder (diseases that affect things like your tendons, ligaments, skin, or cartilage), cancer, or another health problem. Your doctor may need to run tests to figure out the cause.Fever TreatmentsThe most common treatments for fever include over-the-counter drugs such as acetaminophen  and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen. Talk to your doctor about the proper dosage. Never give young children and teens aspirin. It's linked to a rare condition called Reyes syndrome that could damage their liver and brain.What is the best way to treat a fever at home?Drink a lot of clear liquids such as water, broth, and juices. Take a lukewarm bath. Do not use cold water or alcohol.Get plenty of rest. Keep yourself cool with lightweight clothing and bed coverings.If you get the chills, use an extra blanket until they go away.Types of FeverFevers have a wide range of causes, and you might hear your doctor call your fever a certain name. That's because doctors classify five types of fevers based on their patterns.Intermittent. With this type of fever, your temperature rises, but falls back to a normal range during the day. The difference can range from a small increase to about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Remittent. This type of fever rises and falls, but your temperature always stays above normal. Continuous or sustained. Your temperature stays about the same throughout the day. Hectic. This causes big swings in temperature, about 2 degrees F or more, throughout the day. You may also have symptoms like chills and sweats. Relapsing. A relapsing fever spikes after a few days or even weeks of normal temperature. Fever ComplicationsMost fevers get better without any problems, but some can have rare complications, especially in young children.If your child is aged 6 months to 5 years, a fever could put them at risk of a febrile seizure. They usually occur when your child's fever is higher than 100.4 F.  Signs your child could be having a febrile seizure include: They lose consciousness.Their arms and legs shake.Stiff or twitching one side of their body.Febrile seizures usually happen within the first 24 hours of your child's fever, and they might be the first sign your child is sick. Call 911 or your doctor immediately, even if the seizure lasts just a few seconds.  Sources

Bush, MD, FACP, Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, Florida Atlantic
UniversityReviewed/Revised Jul 2024VIEW PROFESSIONAL VERSIONGET THE QUICK FACTSCauses|Evaluation|Treatment|Essentials for Older People|Key Points|Fever is an elevated body temperature that occurs when the body's thermostat (located in the hypothalamus in the brain) resets at a higher temperature, primarily in response to an infection. Elevated body temperature that is not caused by a resetting of the temperature set point is called hyperthermia. Although 98.6° F (37° C) is considered normal temperature, body temperature varies throughout the day. It is lowest in the early morning and highest in the late afternoonsometimes reaching 99.9° F (37.7° C). Similarly, a fever does not stay at a constant temperature. Sometimes temperature peaks every day and then returns to normal. This process is called intermittent fever. Alternatively, temperature varies but does not return to normal. This process is called remittent fever. Doctors no longer think that the pattern of the rise and fall of fever is very important in the diagnosis of certain disorders.Body temperature can be measured at several areas of the body. The most common sites are the mouth (oral temperature) and rectum (rectal temperature). Other sites include the ear, forehead, and, much less preferably, armpit. Temperature is typically measured using a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers containing mercury are not recommended because they can break and expose people to mercury.Oral temperatures are considered elevated whenThey are higher than 99° F (37° C) in the early morning.They are higher than 100.4° F (38° C) at any time after the early morning.They are higher than a persons known normal everyday temperature.Rectal and ear temperatures are about 1.0° F (0.6° C) higher than oral temperatures. Skin temperatures (for example, the forehead) are about 1.0° F (0.6° C) lower than oral temperatures. Many people use the term fever loosely, often meaning that they feel too warm, too cold, or sweaty, but they have not actually measured their temperature.The ability to generate a fever is reduced in certain people (for example, those who are very old, very young, or who have an alcohol use disorder).(See also Overview of Infectious Disease and Fever in Infants and Children.)Consequences of feverThe symptoms people have are due mainly to the condition causing the fever rather than the fever itself.Although many people worry that fever can cause harm, the typical temporary elevations in body temperature ranging from 100.4° to 104° F (38° to 40° C) caused by most short-lived (acute) infections are well-tolerated by healthy adults. As one of the body's defenses against an infection, a fever can trigger the production of antibodies and make it more difficult for microorganisms to grow, and may lessen the severity of an infection and help it go away. However, a moderate fever may be slightly dangerous for adults with a heart or lung disorder because fever causes the heart rate and breathing rate to increase. Fever can also worsen mental status in people with dementia.Additionally, an extreme temperature elevation (typically more than 105.8° F, or 41° C) may be damaging. A body temperature this high can cause malfunction and ultimately failure of most organs. Such extreme elevation sometimes results from very severe infection (such as sepsis, malaria, or meningitis) but is more typically caused by heatstroke or use of certain illicit drugs (such as
or PCP).Fever in healthy children can cause febrile seizures.Causes of Fever in AdultsSubstances that cause fever are called pyrogens. Pyrogens can come from inside or outside the body. Microorganisms and the substances they produce (such as toxins) are examples of pyrogens formed outside the body. Pyrogens formed inside the body are usually produced by 2 types of white blood cells called monocytes and macrophages. Pyrogens from outside the body can cause fever by stimulating the body to release its own pyrogens or by directly affecting the area of the brain that controls temperature.Many disorders can cause fever. They are broadly categorized asInfectious (most common)Neoplastic (cancer)Inflammatory (including autoimmune disorders, allergic reactions, and some drug reactions)An infectious cause is highly likely in adults with a fever that lasts 4 days or less (called an acute fever). An acute fever in people with cancer or a known inflammatory disorder also is most likely to have an infectious cause. In healthy people, an acute fever is unlikely to be the first sign of a chronic illness. A noninfectious cause is more likely to cause fever that lasts a long time or returns. Infectious causesInfections are the most common causes of fever. Infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Virtually all infections can cause fever, but, overall, the most likely infectious causes are the following:Upper and lower respiratory tract infectionsGastrointestinal infectionsUrinary tract infections (UTIs)Skin infectionsMost acute respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections are viral.Neoplastic causesMany cancers cause fever, for example, leukemia, lymphoma, and kidney cancer. Inflammatory causesInflammatory disorders that cause fever include systemic rheumatic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), and giant cell arteritis. Fever may also result from an allergic reaction.Medications and drugs sometimes cause fever. For example, beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin) and sulfa medications can trigger a fever. Certain illicit drugs (such as , amphetamines, or phencyclidine) and medications such as anesthetics and antipsychotics can cause an extremely high temperature.Risk factorsCertain factors help doctors determine what is the most likely cause of fever in a person. These factors include the following:The person's health status, age, and occupationHospitalizationUse of certain medications or illicit drugsExposure to infections (for example, through travel or contact with infected people, animals, or insects)Table Some Causes of Fever Based on Risk FactorsRisk FactorCauseNone (healthy)Upper or lower respiratory tract infectionGastrointestinal infectionUrinary tract infectionSkin infectionHospitalizationBloodstream infection related to a catheter inserted in a vein (IV catheter infection)Urinary tract infection, particularly in people with a urinary catheterPneumonia, particularly in people on a ventilatorAtelectasis (collapse of part of a lung due to an airway blockage, rather than an infection)Infection or a pocket of blood (hematoma) at the site of surgeryDeep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolismDiarrhea (due to Clostridioides difficileinduced colitis)MedicationsTransfusion reactionPressure soresTravel to areas where an infection is common (endemic areas)MalariaViral hepatitisDisorders that cause diarrheaTyphoid feverZika virus, chikungunya, Ebola virus, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, measles, and yellow feverDengue feverFungal infections such as coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, or histoplasmosisRickettsial infections (such as African tick-bite fever and Mediterranean spotted fever)Exposure to insects or animals that carry disease-causing organisms, called vectors (in the United States)Ticks: Rickettsiosis, ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, babesiosis, relapsing fever, or tularemiaMosquitoes: Encephalitis caused by arboviruses, malaria, or Zika virus infection; yellow feverWild animals: Tularemia, rabies, or hantavirus infectionFleas: PlagueDomestic animals: Brucellosis, cat-scratch disease, Q fever, or toxoplasmosisBirds: Psittacosis, bird fluReptiles: Salmonella infectionBats: Rabies or histoplasmosisA weakened immune system (immunocompromise)Viruses: Varicella-zoster virus infection or cytomegalovirus infectionBacteria: Infection due to pneumococci, meningococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Nocardia, or mycobacteriaFungi: Infection due to Candida, Aspergillus, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, microsporidia, Pneumocystis jirovecii, or fungi that cause mucormycosisParasites: Infection due to Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Cryptosporidium, or Cystoisospora belliMedications and illicit drugs that can alter body temperatureAmphetaminesPhencyclidine (PCP)Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or Ecstasy)Antipsychotic medications (can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome)Anesthetics (inhaled anesthetic gases such as halothane can cause malignant hyperthermia)ThyroxineInterferons (medications that are based on substances produced by the immune system and that help block the reproduction of viruses)Medications that can trigger fever by a hypersensitivity (allergic) reactionBeta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin)Sulfa drugsPhenytoinCarbamazepineProcainamideQuinidineEvaluation of Fever in AdultsUsually, a doctor can determine that an infection is present based on a brief history, a physical examination, and occasionally a few simple tests, such as a chest x-ray and urine tests. However, sometimes the cause of fever is not readily identified.When doctors initially evaluate people with an acute fever, they focus on 2 general issues:Identifying other symptoms such as headache or cough: These symptoms help narrow the range of possible causes.Determining whether the person is seriously or chronically ill: Many of the possible acute viral infections go away on their own and also are difficult for doctors to diagnose specifically (that is, to determine exactly which virus is causing the infection). Limiting testing to people who are seriously or chronically ill can help avoid many expensive, unnecessary, and often fruitless searches.Warning signsIn people with an acute fever, certain signs and characteristics are cause for concern. They includeA change in mental function, such as confusionA headache, stiff neck, or bothFlat, small, purplish red spots on the skin (petechiae), which indicate bleeding under the skinLow blood pressureRapid heart rate or rapid breathingShortness of breath (dyspnea)A temperature that is higher than 104° F (40° C) or lower than 95° F (35° C)Recent travel to an area where a serious infectious disease such as malaria is commonRecent use of medications that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants)When to see a doctorPeople who have any warning signs should see a doctor right away. Such people typically need immediate testing and often admission to a hospital.People without warning signs should call the doctor if the fever lasts more than 24 to 48 hours. Depending on the person's age, other symptoms, and known medical conditions, the doctor may ask the person to come for evaluation or recommend treatment at home. Typically, people should see a doctor if a fever lasts more than 3 or 4 days regardless of other symptoms.What the doctor doesDoctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history. Doctors then do a physical examination. What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the fever and the tests that may need to be done.A doctor begins by asking a person about present and previous symptoms and disorders, medications currently being taken, any blood transfusions, exposure to infections, recent travel, vaccinations, and recent hospitalizations, surgeries, or other medical procedures. The pattern of the fever rarely helps the doctor make a diagnosis. However, a fever that returns every other day or every third day is typical of malaria. Doctors consider malaria and other insect-transmitted infections as a possible cause only if people have traveled to an area where the infection is common.Recent travel may give the doctor clues as to the cause of a fever because some infections occur in certain areas. For example, coccidioidomycosis (a fungal infection) occurs mostly in the southwestern United States.Recent exposures are also important. For example, people who work in a meatpacking plant are more likely to develop brucellosis (a bacterial infection spread through contact with domestic animals). Other examples include unsafe water or food (such as unpasteurized milk and milk products, and raw or undercooked meat, fish, and shellfish), insect (such as mosquitoes) and tick bites, unprotected sex, and occupational or recreational exposures (such as hunting, hiking, and water sports).Pain is an important clue to the possible source of fever, so the doctor asks about any pain in the ears, head, neck, teeth, throat, chest, abdomen, flank, rectum, muscles, and joints.Other symptoms that help determine the cause of the fever include nasal congestion and/or discharge, cough, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency, and pain while urinating). Knowing whether the person has enlarged lymph nodes or a rash (including what it looks like, where it is, and when it appeared in relation to other symptoms) may help the doctor pinpoint a cause. People with recurring fevers, night sweats, and weight loss may have a chronic infection such as tuberculosis or endocarditis (infection of the heart's lining and usually the heart valves).The doctor may also ask about the following:Contact with anyone who has an infectionAny known conditions that predispose to infection, such as HIV infection, diabetes, cancer, organ transplantation, sickle cell disease, use of an artificial pacemaker, or heart valve disorders, particularly if an artificial valve is presentAny known disorders that may cause a fever without infection, such as lupus, gout, sarcoidosis, an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), or cancerUse of any medications that may make a person susceptible to infection, such as cancer chemotherapy, corticosteroids, or other medications that suppress the immune systemUse of illicit drugs that are injectedThe physical examination begins with confirmation of fever. Fever is most accurately determined by measuring rectal temperature, but oral or ear temperature is often measured. Forehead temperature is not as accurate as rectal, but doctors may measure forehead temperature to screen people for fever. Armpit temperature is the least accurate, so doctors rarely use it to confirm a fever. Doctors then do a thorough examination from head to toe to check for a source of infection or evidence of disease.TestingThe need for testing depends on what the doctor finds during the medical history and physical examination.Otherwise healthy people who have an acute fever and only vague, general symptoms (for example, they feel generally ill or achy) probably have a viral illness that will go away without treatment. Therefore, they do not usually require testing. Exceptions are people who are in an area where COVID-19 is being spread, people who have been exposed to an animal or insect that carries and transmits a specific disease (called a vector), such as people with a tick bite, and people who have recently been in an area where a particular disorder (such as malaria) is common.If otherwise healthy people have findings that suggest a particular disorder, testing may be needed. Doctors select tests based on those findings. For example, if people have a headache and stiff neck, a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) is done to look for meningitis. If people have a cough and lung congestion, a chest x-ray is done to look for pneumonia. For certain respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19 or influenza, there are rapid molecular tests that can give results within minutes or a few hours. Some rapid tests can be done at home or in a doctor's office on a sample obtained with a cotton swab. Other rapid tests to identify a specific cause of an infection require a blood sample sent to a laboratory.People who are at increased risk of infection, people who appear seriously ill, and older adults often need testing even when findings do not suggest a particular disorder. For such people, doctors may do the following:A complete blood count (including the number and proportion of different types of white blood cells)Urine and blood culturesA chest x-rayUrinalysisLab TestComplete Blood CountLab TestUrinalysisAn increase in the white blood cell count usually indicates infection. The proportion of different types of white blood cells (differential count) gives further clues. For example, an increase in neutrophils suggests a relatively new bacterial infection. An increase in eosinophils suggests the presence of parasites, such as tapeworms or roundworms. Also, blood, urine, and other body fluids may be sent to the laboratory to try to grow the microorganism in a culture. Other blood tests can be used to detect antibodies against specific microorganisms.Fever of unknown origin (FUO)A fever of unknown origin may be diagnosed when People have a fever of at least 101° F (38.3° C) for several weeks.Extensive investigation does not detect a cause.In such cases, the cause may be an unusual chronic infection (such as tuberculosis, bacterial infection of the heart, HIV infection, cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus) or something other than an infection, such as a systemic rheumatic disorder (such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis) or cancer (such as lymphoma, ovarian cancer, or leukemia). Other causes include medication or illicit drug reactions, blood clots (deep vein thrombosis), inflammation of organ tissues (sarcoidosis), and inflammatory bowel disease.In older adults, the most common causes of FUO are giant cell arteritis, lymphomas, abscesses, and tuberculosis.Doctors usually do blood tests, including a complete blood count, blood cultures, liver blood tests, and tests to check for systemic rheumatic disorders. Other tests, such as chest x-ray, urinalysis, and urine culture, may be done.Lab TestBacteria Culture TestUltrasound studies, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly of areas that are causing discomfort, may help a doctor diagnose the cause. Radionuclide scanning, done after white blood cells labeled with a radioactive marker are injected into a vein, or positron emission tomography (PET) may be used to identify areas of infection or inflammation.If these test results are negative, doctors may need to take a sample of tissue from the liver, bone marrow, or another site of suspected infection for biopsy. The sample is then examined under a microscope, cultured, and analyzed.The treatment of FUO is focused on treating the disorder causing the fever if it is known. Doctors may give medications to lower the body temperature (see treatment of fever).Treatment of Fever in AdultsThe best fever treatment is treatment of the cause.Because fever helps the body defend against infection and because fever itself is not dangerous (unless it is higher than about 106° F [41° C]), there is some debate as to whether fever should be routinely treated. However, people with a high fever generally feel much better when the fever is treated. Plus, people with a heart or lung disorder and those with dementia are considered to be at particular risk of dangerous complications, so when they have a fever, it should be treated.Medications used to lower body temperature are called antipyretics.Because many over-the-counter cold or flu preparations contain acetaminophen, people must be careful not to take acetaminophen and one or more of these cold or flu preparations at the same time.Other cooling measures (such as cooling with a tepid water mist and using cooling blankets) are needed only if the temperature is about 106° F (41.1° C) or higher. People should not apply rubbing alcohol to their skin with a washcloth or sponge because alcohol can be absorbed through the skin and may have harmful effects.People who have a blood infection (bacteremia) or who have abnormal vital signs (such as low blood pressure and a rapid pulse and breathing rate) are admitted to the hospital.Essentials for Older People: FeverFever can be tricky in older people because the body may not respond the way it would in younger people. For example, in frail older adults, infection is less likely to cause fever. Even when elevated by infection, the temperature may be lower than the standard definition of fever, and the degree of fever may not correspond to the severity of the illness. Similarly, other symptoms, such as pain, may be less noticeable. Frequently, a change in mental function or a decline in daily functioning is the only other initial sign of pneumonia or a urinary tract infection.However, older adults with a fever are more likely to have a serious bacterial infection than are younger adults with a fever. As in younger adults, the cause is commonly a respiratory or urinary tract infection. Skin and soft-tissue infections are also common causes of fever in older adults. Older adults are more likely to have serious manifestations of respiratory viral infections such as influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Diagnosis of fever in older adults is similar to that for younger adults, except that for older adults, doctors usually recommend urine tests (including culture) and a chest x-ray. Samples of blood are cultured to rule out a blood infection (bacteremia).Key PointsMost fevers in healthy people are caused by a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection due to a virus.If people with a fever have any warning signs, they should see a doctor right away.Doctors can usually identify an infection based on a brief medical history, a physical examination, and occasionally a few simple tests, and then doctors use these results, particularly symptoms, to determine which other tests are needed.Doctors consider underlying chronic disorders, particularly those that impair the immune system, as a possible cause of fever that lasts a long time.In older adults, infections are less likely to cause fever, and other symptoms may be less noticeable.Test your KnowledgeTake a Quiz!

What Is Coronavirus?
COVID Symptoms  Frequently Asked Questions
Infectious Diseases
Reviewed By:
Lisa Lockerd Maragakis, M.D., M.P.H.
Updated on January 27, 2022
Do you know the symptoms of COVID-19? Knowing the warning signs can help you take the right steps if you or loved ones become sick. Lisa Maragakis, M.D., M.P.H., senior director of infection prevention for the Johns Hopkins Health System, explains what to look for and when to get help.
What are symptoms of COVID-19?
The most common symptoms are:
Cough
Fever or chills
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Muscle or body aches
Sore throat
New loss of taste or smell
Diarrhea
Headache
Fatigue
Nausea or vomiting
Congestion or runny nose
Some of these symptoms are very common and can occur due to many conditions other than COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus called SARS CoV-2. If you have any of the symptoms, contact a doctor or other health care provider, who can assess your risk and help you determine the next steps.
Emergency Warning Signs of Severe COVID-19  When to Call 911
If you or someone in your household is experiencing any of the following symptoms, call 911 or your local emergency room right away and let the operator know that you are calling for someone who might have COVID-19:
Difficulty breathing
Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
New confusion
Inability to wake up or stay awake
Bluish lips or face
There are other possible symptoms of COVID-19. Call your doctor or health care center regarding any symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
When should I contact a doctor about my symptoms?
If you feel ill, call your doctors office or health care center and explain your symptoms over the phone. The next steps will be discussed, including whether you should have a coronavirus test. If it turns out that you have COVID-19, mild cases can be managed at home with rest and self-isolation. If you become severely ill, you may need hospital care.
If Im exposed to the coronavirus, how long will it be before I might develop symptoms?
Symptoms can begin two to 14 days after you have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. A study led by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health shows that the median time for symptoms to show up is about five days, however, CDC research suggests that the median time for omicron symptoms to develop is about three days.
If you suspect you were exposed to or had close contact with someone with COVID-19, you should self-quarantine, watch for symptoms and consider getting tested four or five days following the exposure. Exposure is contact with someone infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in a way that increases the likelihood of becoming infected with the virus. Close contact is being less than 6 feet away from an infected person (laboratory-confirmed or a clinical diagnosis) for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more during a 24-hour period.
Please review CDC guidelines for isolation and quarantine to help prevent the spread of COVID-19
What are the first symptoms of coronavirus infection?
Early symptoms reported by some people include fatigue, headache, sore throat and fever. Others experience a loss of smell or taste. COVID-19 can cause symptoms that are mild at first, but then become more intense over five to seven days, with worsening cough and shortness of breath. Some people who have COVID-19 develop pneumonia.
The type and severity of first symptoms can vary widely from person to person. This is why it is very important to call your doctor if you have symptoms, even mild ones.
Can you have the coronavirus without a fever?
Yes. A fever is one of the common symptoms of COVID-19, but you can be infected with the coronavirus and have a cough or other symptoms with no fever, or a very low-grade one  especially in the first few days. Keep in mind that it is also possible to have the coronavirus with minimal symptoms or even no symptoms at all. People infected with the coronavirus who have no symptoms can still spread the virus to others.
Can you have the coronavirus without a cough?
Yes. A cough is one of the common symptoms of COVID-19, but it is not always present. You can be infected with the coronavirus and not have a cough. If you do have one, it may be mild and infrequent, or you may cough heavily at times. Remember that it is possible to have COVID-19 with minimal symptoms or even no symptoms at all. People infected with the coronavirus who have no symptoms can still spread the virus to others.
Can COVID-19 symptoms come and go?
Yes. During the recovery process, people with COVID-19 might experience recurring symptoms alternating with periods of feeling better. Varying degrees of fever, fatigue and breathing problems can occur, on and off, for days or even weeks.
Can you have COVID-19 without symptoms?
Yes. Symptoms of COVID-19 usually show up two to 14 days after exposure to SARS-CoV-2, but some people who are infected do not develop symptoms or feel ill. When this happens, a person is called asymptomatic. This is why it is so important to wear a face mask and to practice physical distancing and hand hygiene. People can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and not realize it, but still be able to transmit the virus to other people.
What are COVID-19 symptoms in children?
Like adults, babies and children with COVID-19 can have symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, difficulty breathing and diarrhea. Cases have been increasing among children, as indicated by recent data from the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Children may also be at risk for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)  an uncommon but serious complication of the coronavirus. Parents and guardians should be on guard for signs of MIS-C and call their childs doctor immediately if they appear.
Coronavirus Symptoms and Other Conditions:
How are coronavirus symptoms different from allergy symptoms? What about flu, colds and strep throat?
COVID-19 shares symptoms with other conditions such as allergies, the flu and strep throat. It may be very hard to tell the difference between COVID-19 and flu without a test.
If you have symptoms that might be due to the coronavirus, contact a health care provider, describe your symptoms and follow the providers recommendations.
Learn more about COVID-19 and the flu.
If I receive the coronavirus vaccine, will I get COVID-19 symptoms?
No. The COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the Food and Drug Administration cannot and will not give you COVID-19. These coronavirus vaccines can cause side effects because they activate your immune system, but this does not mean you are infected with the coronavirus or that you have COVID-19. As your immune system responds to the vaccine and learns to recognize and fight the coronavirus, fever, pain at the injection site and muscle aches are possible, but these are usually both mild and temporary. Learn more about the safety of the coronavirus vaccines.

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm  or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs)  also known as your body's "thermostat"  monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children.

Medical News TodayHealth ConditionsHealth ProductsDiscoverToolsConnectSubscribeWhen is a fever in adults serious?Medically reviewed by Alana Biggers, M.D., MPH  Written by Rachel Nall, MSN, CRNA
on March 31, 2020When to seek helpNormalTypes and causesComplicationsCOVID-19TreatmentPreventionSummarySevere illness can cause extremely high temperatures in adults that can be life threatening. A high-grade fever from a rectal measurement is typically 104.1106.0°F (4041.1°C).When certain pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, enter the body, the immune system signals the body to increase its temperature in an attempt to destroy them.This article will discuss how a fever affects an adults body and when it is cause for concern.If a person is concerned about a fever or how they feel overall, they should talk to a doctor.When is a fever serious?Share on PinterestDoctors consider a temperature above 104°F (40°C) to be a high-grade fever.As a general rule, adults should consider seeking medical attention if their temperature reaches above 104 °F (40°C). Doctors consider this temperature to be a high-grade fever.However, a fever is not the only symptom a person has when they are ill. A person should consider other symptoms, such as vomiting, breathing issues, confusion, or how they feel overall when deciding whether they need medical attention. Normal body temperaturesDoctors categorize a fever by the reading on the thermometer, how long the fever lasts, and whether it keeps going up and down.Normal body temperature can fluctuate. According to a 2019 systematic review, typical body temperatures vary according to a persons age, and whether they take their temperature orally or rectally. The table below indicates a range of normal body temperatures.AgesOral °F (°C)Rectal °F (°C)Mean temperature97.8 (36.5)98.6 (37.0)Less than 60 years of age98.1 (36.7)98.8 (37.1)Over 60 years of age97.5 (36.4)98.6 (37.0)It is important to note that temperatures can fluctuate. A normal rectal body temperature ranges from 98.6100.4°F.Types and causes of feverThe following are the classifications of body temperature ranges, according to an article in the Journal of Infection and Public Health: Mild or low-grade fever: 100.4102.2°F (3839°C)Moderate grade fever: 102.2104.0°F (39°C40°C)High-grade fever: 104.1106.0°F (40°C41.1°C)These temperature values are rectal measurements, which doctors consider the most accurate. However, the article also emphasizes that doctors can better diagnose a persons condition by considering their other symptoms rather than the severity of their temperature. Sustained or continuous feverA sustained fever is when a person has a temperature above normal that does not fluctuate by more than 1.5°F (1°C) for 24 hours. Causes may include:Gram-negative bacteria: These are bacteria that can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and surgical site infections.Typhoid: Typhoid is a bacterial infection that can cause fever.Acute bacterial meningitis: This is a severe infection that requires emergency medical help.Urinary tract infection (UTI): Cystitis is an infection of the bladder, and urethritis is an infection of the urethra.Intermittent feverAn intermittent fever occurs when a person experiences a raised temperature for several hours a day. The temperature then goes back to normal before spiking again. Common causes may include:Malaria: This is an infection that some mosquitoes transmit.Tuberculosis (TB): This is an infection of the lungs.Lymphoma: This is a form of cancer that begins in the cells.Sepsis: This occurs when the body has an extreme reaction to an infection.Remittent feverThis is a daily fever that is always higher than normal but may fluctuate as much as 3.6°F (2°C) throughout the day. Common causes may include:Infective endocarditis: This is an infection of the endocardium, which is the membrane that lines the inside of the heart.Rickettsiae infections: This is an infection transmitted by ticks, mites, and lice.Potential complicationsPeople who experience an internal temperature of 104°F (40°C) and higher for prolonged periods can develop hyperthermia. For this reason, it is essential to try to keep a fever from becoming too high.Potential complications from a high-grade fever can include:seizuresunsteadinessunconsciousnesslethargycomaA high-grade fever can also cause cognitive dysfunction, which affects a persons memory, comprehension, reasoning, and problem-solving ability. Some people may also have difficulty paying attention. Typically, these symptoms are only temporary, and most people recover. However, in extreme circumstances, some people experience permanent changes.Fever and COVID-19Fever is a common symptom of the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19. According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February 2020, data on 1,099 people in China who had COVID-19 showed that 43.8% had a fever on admission to the hospital. An estimated 88.7% developed a fever during their hospitalization. The authors defined a fever as an axillary (armpit) temperature of 99.8°F (37.7°C) or higher. Other symptoms include:a coughshortness of breathnauseavomitingdiarrheaIf a person suspects they may have COVID-19, they should call a doctor or health department for further testing.

Scientists are still in debate whether a person should treat a low-grade fever.However, if a person does have a fever or does not feel well, they could take fever-reducing medications, such as: acetaminophenibuprofen aspirinAs a fever is typically a symptom of another condition, a person may require different treatments depending on the cause. If a person has an underlying bacterial illness, a doctor may prescribe antibiotics. These can treat the infection, which can help reduce fever. Other steps a person can take to make themselves more comfortable include resting, drinking plenty of fluids, wearing loose clothing, and taking cool or lukewarm baths. PreventionThere are some steps a person can take to help prevent getting a fever:Always cover the mouth and nose when sneezing and wash hands immediately after sneezing or coughing. Refrain from sharing personal items, such as utensils, cups, and even toothbrushes. Try not to touch the face. A person can easily transmit the pathogen from their face to their nose or mouth, which might allow the germs to enter the body. Avoid contact with people who are sick. This can help prevent the transmission of illness.Maintain good hygiene. Washing hands may help prevent bacteria and viruses from spreading. Learn more about washing hands properly here.Summary A fever is a protective mechanism for the body as the immune system works to fight against illness in a variety of ways. If a person feels very unwell in addition to having a fever or they are already immunocompromised due to pre-existing conditions, they should seek medical attention. A person should also see their doctor if they have tried to control their fever at home, but over-the-counter medicines and other treatments are ineffective. A fever can become dangerous if it reaches 104°F (40°C) or higher.

Most providers say a fever is either 100.0 F (37.8 C) or 100.4 F (38 C). When you have a fever, its your bodys normal response to fighting an infection or illness. Fevers usually arent a serious concern. They typically go away when the infection passes.ContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat is a fever?A fever is when your body temperature rises higher than normal. A fever itself isnt an illness. Rather, its a symptom of a wide range of health conditions. When your body temperature rises a few degrees above normal, it can be a sign that your immune system has been activated, often to fight an infection. It can also be a side effect of some medications and vaccinations.What is considered a fever?Common knowledge states that a normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). But your baseline body temperature may vary by a degree or more. It also fluctuates. Its typically lower in the morning and higher in the evening. Its higher during certain points of your menstrual cycle and when youre exercising.Infants and young children normally have slightly higher body temperatures than older children and adults. So infants and younger children have slightly higher fever temperatures.There are no strict guidelines for what temperature is a fever, because body temperature varies by person, time of day and method of measurement. But healthcare providers most often say a fever temperature is 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) when measured orally (by mouth).Rectal and ear thermometers typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) higher than oral thermometers. Skin thermometers (such as forehead thermometers) typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) lower than oral thermometers.What is a low-grade fever?A low-grade fever means a body temperature slightly above normal. This type of fever can be a sign your immune system has been mildly activated. Theres no standard low-grade fever range. But many healthcare providers consider a body temperature between 99.5 degrees F (37.5 degrees C) and 100.3 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) to be a low-grade fever.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat are fever symptoms?In addition to an elevated temperature, you may experience the following symptoms:Chills, feeling cold, shivering and shaking.Body aches and headaches.Fatigue (tiredness).On and off or constant sweating.Flushed complexion or hot skin.Faster heart beats.Additional fever symptoms in babies and children may include:Lack of appetite  not eating and drinking well.Earache or pulling at their ears.High-pitched crying.Fussiness.Paleness or flushness.Excessive thirst.Decreased urination.Possible CausesWhat are the most common causes of fever?A fever has many causes and can be a symptom of almost any illness. Common conditions that cause fever include:Bacterial infections.Viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19.Gastrointestinal (GI) infections.Urinary tract infections.Skin infections.You may also develop a fever due to:A reaction to certain medications.Vaccinations.Autoimmune disorders.Cancer.Can allergies cause fever?Allergies can cause cold-like symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes, but they typically dont cause fever. Despite its name, hay fever (also called allergic rhinitis) doesnt cause fever.AdvertisementCare and TreatmentWhats the best way to measure body temperature?You can take your temperature in several different parts of your body. The most common site is your mouth (oral temperature). Other sites include your ear (tympanic membrane), forehead (temporal artery) and armpit (axillary). The most accurate site is the rectum, and the least accurate site is the armpit.The best way to measure your temperature is with a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers contain mercury and providers no longer recommend them.How can I break a fever at home?If your fever is mild  less than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C)  you usually dont need treatment with medication. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. Taking a lukewarm bath  about 98 degrees F (36.7 degrees C)  may also help bring your bodys temperature down. Keep an eye on signs of dehydration and other worsening symptoms.If youre feeling uncomfortable and your temperature is higher than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C), you can try to break the fever. The most common way to get rid of a fever is to use over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.Dont give aspirin to children under the age of 17. Aspirin in children may cause Reyes syndrome, a sometimes fatal illness.Does ibuprofen reduce fever?Yes, you can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen to try to reduce a fever.How long does a fever last?The cause of the fever determines how long itll last. Typically, if an infection is the cause of your fever, it should pass within three to four days. Call your healthcare provider if the fever lingers longer than that or comes along with breathing changes.AdvertisementCan fevers be prevented?You can prevent some fevers by avoiding the illnesses and infections that cause them. Sometimes, children develop fevers after receiving vaccinations. You can prevent these types of fevers by giving your child acetaminophen just before or after the vaccination. But you cant prevent most fevers. Theyre typically a sign that your body is doing what its supposed to do.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentWhen To Call the DoctorWhen should a fever be treated by a healthcare provider?In adults, fevers less than 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) typically arent dangerous and arent a cause for concern. If your fever rises above that level, make a call to your healthcare provider for treatment.In children, call your childs healthcare provider if:Their fever lasts more than five days.Their fever is higher than 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen dont break the fever.Youre concerned they arent behaving normally.They have any problems breathing or urinating.When should I go to the ER?If you have a fever along with any of the following symptoms, go to your nearest emergency room or call 911. It may be a sign of a serious or life-threatening illness.Pain or tenderness in your belly (abdomen).Nausea or vomiting.Severe headache.Stiff neck.Light irritates your eyes (photophobia).Convulsions or seizures.Difficulty breathing.Strange behavior and/or altered speech.Confusion or irritability.Difficulty waking or extreme sleepiness.Fever rash (small bleeding spots under your skin).When should I take my child to the ER?If your baby has a fever and is under 3 months of age, take them to the ER right away. Your babys immune system hasnt developed fully yet, and they could have a serious infection.If your child has a fever along with any of the following symptoms, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room:Extreme sluggishness or drowsiness.Lack of appetite.Excessive drooling or difficulty swallowing.Continuous crying.Stiff neck.Fever rash.Difficulty breathing.Severe abdominal pain.Redness or swelling.Dehydration (not drinking many fluids).Decreased urination.What are the possible complications or risks of not treating a fever?Untreated fevers above 105.8 degrees F (41 degrees C) can be dangerous. If your body temperature reaches this level, your organs will begin to malfunction and will eventually fail.Even moderate fevers can be dangerous for adults with lung or heart disorders because fever causes your breathing rate and heart rate to increase. Fever can also worsen the mental state of people with dementia.Additional Common QuestionsWhat is a recurrent fever?A recurrent fever is a fever that keeps coming back multiple times over a period of time. Providers call these fevers episodic because they come and go. The fever lasts for a few days and then goes away for a stretch of time. Your child is healthy and acts normally between fevers. Recurrent fevers affect young children under the age of 5 most often. Theyre one of the main symptoms of a collection of conditions called periodic fever syndromes.What is a febrile seizure?Some children have a side effect of fevers called febrile seizures. This happens in 2% to 4% of children under the age of 5. Some seizures cause jerking movements, or it may look like your child has passed out. When this happens, put your child on their side and dont put anything in their mouth. Call 911 if the seizure lasts for more than five minutes and/or your childs lips turn blue.If the seizure lasts less than five minutes, notify their healthcare provider and get medical attention right away.What is a fever dream?Fever dreams are vivid, bizarre or unpleasant dreams you may experience when your body temperature rises higher than normal. Researchers dont know the exact cause of fever dreams. But some scientists think fevers cause your brain to overheat, affecting your cognitive processing, which results in dreams stranger than your typical dreams. Fevers may also interrupt your REM sleep cycle, which can lead to unusual dreams.A note from Cleveland ClinicWhile a fever can be uncomfortable, its typically a sign that your body is working properly and your immune system is kicking into action. You dont need to treat low fevers, but you can take over-the-counter pain relievers until they pass. If you or your child has a higher temperature or your fever hasnt passed within a few days, you should make a call to your healthcare provider. While infections most often cause fevers, there could be other underlying conditions youll want to get checked out.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 05/31/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Fever in adults: When to worry
Infection is a common cause of fever, but other conditions can also bring the heat.
May 22, 2023
Reviewed by
Howard E. LeWine, MD,
Chief Medical Editor, Harvard Health Publishing
Fever is one of the body's most effective ways of fighting infection. It is part of your body's defense against infection-causing germs.
You get a fever most often when your body is trying to kill infectious invaders such as viruses or bacteria. A higher body temperature helps the immune system respond more vigorously to the attack, and makes it harder for these microbes to survive.
What is considered a fever in adults?
The average body temperature is 98.6° F (37°C). But "normal" body temperature varies from person to person. It also changes during the day, rising a bit after you eat or exercise. Body temperature is often higher in the afternoon than it is when you wake up in the morning.
Fever means a body temperature of 100.4° F (38°C) or higher.
High fever in adults
While any temperature above your normal temperature range is considered a fever, there are different levels of fever severity:
Low-grade: 99.1 to 100.4 F (37.3 to 38.0 C)
Moderate-grade: 100.6 to 102.2 F (38.1 to 39.0 C)
High-grade: 102.4 to 105.8 F (39.1 to 41 C).
When to worry about fever
If you have a fever over 104°F (40°C), you should call your doctor.
Seek medical help right away if you have a fever along with any of these symptoms:
seizure
loss of consciousness
confusion
stiff neck
trouble breathing
severe pain anywhere in the body
swelling or inflammation of any part of the body
vaginal discharge that is discolored or smells bad
pain when urinating or urine that smells bad.
Causes of fever
An infection, such as the flu, is the most common cause of fever.
Other conditions can also cause a fever. These include diseases that produce inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis; reactions to drugs or vaccines; and even certain types of cancers.
Accompanying symptoms
The following symptoms may also accompany fever:
sweats
chills
headache
achy muscles
lack of desire to eat
rash
restlessness
weakness.
A very high fever can cause confusion, extreme sleepiness, irritability, and seizures.
Diagnosing the cause of a fever
To help determine why you have a fever, your doctor will ask you about:
other symptoms such as coughing, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or pain when urinating
recent surgeries or injuries
recent vaccinations
new drugs you may be taking
recent travel, particularly travel abroad.
How to treat a fever at home
By itself, fever is usually harmless, though a high fever can be miserable. These steps may help you feel better:
Drink plenty of fluids to help cool your body and prevent dehydration.
Eat light foods that are easy to digest.
Get plenty of rest.
Take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, or others), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, or others), or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) to help relieve head and body aches and lower your temperature.
Take a slightly warm (not cool) bath, or apply damp washcloths to the forehead and wrists.

A fever is a sure sign your body is fighting off some type of infection. (Photo credit: E+/Getty Images)
A fever is when you have a brief rise in body temperature thats higher than your normal body temperature. Its also called a high temperature, hyperthermia, or pyrexia. It's usually a sign your immune system is working to fight some type of infection. Fever temperaturesNormal body temperatures are different for everyone, but they usually fall within the range of 97 to 99 degrees F. A temperature of 100.4 or higher is considered a fever, but there is no medical standard. The type of thermometer you use affects the temperature you get, as some are more accurate than others. Here's a breakdown of what's considered a fever by age and temperature: Babies age 0-2 years100.4 F (rectal, forehead, or ear temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature)Children ages 2-5 years100.4 F (rectal, forehead, or ear temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature)Children ages 5 and older100.4 F (ear temperature)100 F (oral temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature) Adults100.4 F (oral temperature)A low-grade fever is when you have a temperature that is slightly higher than normal, usually around 99.5 to 100.3 F. A low-grade fever signals that something is going on to activate your immune system.When Is Fever Dangerous?A fever can make you uncomfortable, but it's generally not cause for concern. You can often manage a fever at home, but in some cases you should call your doctor. Fever in babies: When to worryCheck in with your doctor if your baby younger than 3 months:Has a rectal temperature higher than 100.4 F. Has fever higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Has other symptoms, such as a cough or diarrhea.Call 911 or go to the ER if your baby has a seizure.Check in with your doctor if your baby 3 to 6 months old: Has a rectal or oral temperature higher than 100.4 F and is also irritable or sleepy.Has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Call your doctor or go to the ER if your baby won't stop crying and cant be consoled.  Fever in children: When to worryYou should reach out to your pediatrician if your child 6 months to 2 years:Has a fever higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Has other symptoms, such as a cough or diarrhea.If their fever comes with rash, real discomfort, irritability, low energy, headache, stiff neck, or repeated diarrhea or vomiting.Their fever is higher than 104 F, which can cause a seizure.Call 911 or go to the ER if your child has a seizure.Their fever doesnt go down after taking over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen.They've recently had vaccines.Fever in adults: When to worryCall your doctor or visit urgent care or an emergency room if:You have a temperature of 103 F or higher.Your fever doesnt go down after taking over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen.Youve been in contact with someone who has COVID-19.If you have a fever that is 102 degrees or higher, especially if you're in your first trimester of pregnancy. When to call the doctorCall 911 if you or your child have any of these symptoms:UnresponsiveWheezing or difficulty breathingBlue lipsConvulsions or seizuresSpeaking in a confused way A fever with a stiff neck or headacheTemperature higher than 105 FFever with sudden onset of rashSevere stomach pain or persistent vomitingSkin rashes, blisters, or a red streak on an arm or legA severe sore throat, swelling of the throat, or earachePain with urination (peeing), back pain, or shaking chillsA serious cough, or coughing up bloodContact your doctor if your fever lasts for more than 3 days or gets worse.Fever SymptomsA fever is a sign of an illness or infection. When you have one, you may notice these symptoms:Chills or shiveringSweatingBody achesHeadacheLethargy (feeling weak)Being irritableLoss of appetiteDehydrationRed or flushed faceBabies and children might also have:Earache (or pulling at their ears)High-pitch criesLoss of appetiteExtra thirstLow urine output (peeing less than usual)What Causes Fever?A fever can be a sign of several health conditions, which may or may not need medical treatment.The most common causes are infections such as colds and stomach bugs (gastroenteritis). Other causes include:Infections of the ear, lung, skin, throat, bladder, or kidneyHeat exhaustionViral infections like the flu or COVID-19SunburnConditions that cause inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritisSide effects of medicationsVaccines and immunizationsBlood clotsAutoimmune conditions such as lupus and inflammatory bowel disease (IBS)CancerHormone disorders such as hyperthyroidismIllegal drugs such as amphetamines and cocaineTeething in babies can cause a mild, low-grade fever (not over 101 degrees).Fever DiagnosisAlthough a fever is easy to measure with a thermometer, finding its cause can be hard. If you see your doctor, they'll do a physical exam and ask questions about your symptoms, other health conditions you have, medications you take, and if you've recently traveled to areas that have health risks. A malaria infection, for example, may cause a high fever that gets better and then comes back in cycles. Some areas of the U.S. are hot spots for infections such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Your doctor may ask if you have been around someone with COVID-19 or have any other symptoms of COVID-19.Sometimes, you may have a "fever of unknown origin." That means whatever's causing your fever isn't clear. Instead, it could be more unusual like a connective tissue disorder (diseases that affect things like your tendons, ligaments, skin, or cartilage), cancer, or another health problem. Your doctor may need to run tests to figure out the cause.Fever TreatmentsThe most common treatments for fever include over-the-counter drugs such as acetaminophen  and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen. Talk to your doctor about the proper dosage. Never give young children and teens aspirin. It's linked to a rare condition called Reyes syndrome that could damage their liver and brain.What is the best way to treat a fever at home?Drink a lot of clear liquids such as water, broth, and juices. Take a lukewarm bath. Do not use cold water or alcohol.Get plenty of rest. Keep yourself cool with lightweight clothing and bed coverings.If you get the chills, use an extra blanket until they go away.Types of FeverFevers have a wide range of causes, and you might hear your doctor call your fever a certain name. That's because doctors classify five types of fevers based on their patterns.Intermittent. With this type of fever, your temperature rises, but falls back to a normal range during the day. The difference can range from a small increase to about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Remittent. This type of fever rises and falls, but your temperature always stays above normal. Continuous or sustained. Your temperature stays about the same throughout the day. Hectic. This causes big swings in temperature, about 2 degrees F or more, throughout the day. You may also have symptoms like chills and sweats. Relapsing. A relapsing fever spikes after a few days or even weeks of normal temperature. Fever ComplicationsMost fevers get better without any problems, but some can have rare complications, especially in young children.If your child is aged 6 months to 5 years, a fever could put them at risk of a febrile seizure. They usually occur when your child's fever is higher than 100.4 F.  Signs your child could be having a febrile seizure include: They lose consciousness.Their arms and legs shake.Stiff or twitching one side of their body.Febrile seizures usually happen within the first 24 hours of your child's fever, and they might be the first sign your child is sick. Call 911 or your doctor immediately, even if the seizure lasts just a few seconds.  Sources

on March 31, 2020When to seek helpNormalTypes and causesComplicationsCOVID-19TreatmentPreventionSummarySevere illness can cause extremely high temperatures in adults that can be life threatening. A high-grade fever from a rectal measurement is typically 104.1106.0°F (4041.1°C).When certain pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, enter the body, the immune system signals the body to increase its temperature in an attempt to destroy them.This article will discuss how a fever affects an adults body and when it is cause for concern.If a person is concerned about a fever or how they feel overall, they should talk to a doctor.When is a fever serious?Share on PinterestDoctors consider a temperature above 104°F (40°C) to be a high-grade fever.As a general rule, adults should consider seeking medical attention if their temperature reaches above 104 °F (40°C). Doctors consider this temperature to be a high-grade fever.However, a fever is not the only symptom a person has when they are ill. A person should consider other symptoms, such as vomiting, breathing issues, confusion, or how they feel overall when deciding whether they need medical attention. Normal body temperaturesDoctors categorize a fever by the reading on the thermometer, how long the fever lasts, and whether it keeps going up and down.Normal body temperature can fluctuate. According to a 2019 systematic review, typical body temperatures vary according to a persons age, and whether they take their temperature orally or rectally. The table below indicates a range of normal body temperatures.AgesOral °F (°C)Rectal °F (°C)Mean temperature97.8 (36.5)98.6 (37.0)Less than 60 years of age98.1 (36.7)98.8 (37.1)Over 60 years of age97.5 (36.4)98.6 (37.0)It is important to note that temperatures can fluctuate. A normal rectal body temperature ranges from 98.6100.4°F.Types and causes of feverThe following are the classifications of body temperature ranges, according to an article in the Journal of Infection and Public Health: Mild or low-grade fever: 100.4102.2°F (3839°C)Moderate grade fever: 102.2104.0°F (39°C40°C)High-grade fever: 104.1106.0°F (40°C41.1°C)These temperature values are rectal measurements, which doctors consider the most accurate. However, the article also emphasizes that doctors can better diagnose a persons condition by considering their other symptoms rather than the severity of their temperature. Sustained or continuous feverA sustained fever is when a person has a temperature above normal that does not fluctuate by more than 1.5°F (1°C) for 24 hours. Causes may include:Gram-negative bacteria: These are bacteria that can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and surgical site infections.Typhoid: Typhoid is a bacterial infection that can cause fever.Acute bacterial meningitis: This is a severe infection that requires emergency medical help.Urinary tract infection (UTI): Cystitis is an infection of the bladder, and urethritis is an infection of the urethra.Intermittent feverAn intermittent fever occurs when a person experiences a raised temperature for several hours a day. The temperature then goes back to normal before spiking again. Common causes may include:Malaria: This is an infection that some mosquitoes transmit.Tuberculosis (TB): This is an infection of the lungs.Lymphoma: This is a form of cancer that begins in the cells.Sepsis: This occurs when the body has an extreme reaction to an infection.Remittent feverThis is a daily fever that is always higher than normal but may fluctuate as much as 3.6°F (2°C) throughout the day. Common causes may include:Infective endocarditis: This is an infection of the endocardium, which is the membrane that lines the inside of the heart.Rickettsiae infections: This is an infection transmitted by ticks, mites, and lice.Potential complicationsPeople who experience an internal temperature of 104°F (40°C) and higher for prolonged periods can develop hyperthermia. For this reason, it is essential to try to keep a fever from becoming too high.Potential complications from a high-grade fever can include:seizuresunsteadinessunconsciousnesslethargycomaA high-grade fever can also cause cognitive dysfunction, which affects a persons memory, comprehension, reasoning, and problem-solving ability. Some people may also have difficulty paying attention. Typically, these symptoms are only temporary, and most people recover. However, in extreme circumstances, some people experience permanent changes.Fever and COVID-19Fever is a common symptom of the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19. According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February 2020, data on 1,099 people in China who had COVID-19 showed that 43.8% had a fever on admission to the hospital. An estimated 88.7% developed a fever during their hospitalization. The authors defined a fever as an axillary (armpit) temperature of 99.8°F (37.7°C) or higher. Other symptoms include:a coughshortness of breathnauseavomitingdiarrheaIf a person suspects they may have COVID-19, they should call a doctor or health department for further testing.

Scientists are still in debate whether a person should treat a low-grade fever.However, if a person does have a fever or does not feel well, they could take fever-reducing medications, such as: acetaminophenibuprofen aspirinAs a fever is typically a symptom of another condition, a person may require different treatments depending on the cause. If a person has an underlying bacterial illness, a doctor may prescribe antibiotics. These can treat the infection, which can help reduce fever. Other steps a person can take to make themselves more comfortable include resting, drinking plenty of fluids, wearing loose clothing, and taking cool or lukewarm baths. PreventionThere are some steps a person can take to help prevent getting a fever:Always cover the mouth and nose when sneezing and wash hands immediately after sneezing or coughing. Refrain from sharing personal items, such as utensils, cups, and even toothbrushes. Try not to touch the face. A person can easily transmit the pathogen from their face to their nose or mouth, which might allow the germs to enter the body. Avoid contact with people who are sick. This can help prevent the transmission of illness.Maintain good hygiene. Washing hands may help prevent bacteria and viruses from spreading. Learn more about washing hands properly here.Summary A fever is a protective mechanism for the body as the immune system works to fight against illness in a variety of ways. If a person feels very unwell in addition to having a fever or they are already immunocompromised due to pre-existing conditions, they should seek medical attention. A person should also see their doctor if they have tried to control their fever at home, but over-the-counter medicines and other treatments are ineffective. A fever can become dangerous if it reaches 104°F (40°C) or higher.

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm  or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs)  also known as your body's "thermostat"  monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children.

Most providers say a fever is either 100.0 F (37.8 C) or 100.4 F (38 C). When you have a fever, its your bodys normal response to fighting an infection or illness. Fevers usually arent a serious concern. They typically go away when the infection passes.ContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat is a fever?A fever is when your body temperature rises higher than normal. A fever itself isnt an illness. Rather, its a symptom of a wide range of health conditions. When your body temperature rises a few degrees above normal, it can be a sign that your immune system has been activated, often to fight an infection. It can also be a side effect of some medications and vaccinations.What is considered a fever?Common knowledge states that a normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). But your baseline body temperature may vary by a degree or more. It also fluctuates. Its typically lower in the morning and higher in the evening. Its higher during certain points of your menstrual cycle and when youre exercising.Infants and young children normally have slightly higher body temperatures than older children and adults. So infants and younger children have slightly higher fever temperatures.There are no strict guidelines for what temperature is a fever, because body temperature varies by person, time of day and method of measurement. But healthcare providers most often say a fever temperature is 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) when measured orally (by mouth).Rectal and ear thermometers typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) higher than oral thermometers. Skin thermometers (such as forehead thermometers) typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) lower than oral thermometers.What is a low-grade fever?A low-grade fever means a body temperature slightly above normal. This type of fever can be a sign your immune system has been mildly activated. Theres no standard low-grade fever range. But many healthcare providers consider a body temperature between 99.5 degrees F (37.5 degrees C) and 100.3 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) to be a low-grade fever.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat are fever symptoms?In addition to an elevated temperature, you may experience the following symptoms:Chills, feeling cold, shivering and shaking.Body aches and headaches.Fatigue (tiredness).On and off or constant sweating.Flushed complexion or hot skin.Faster heart beats.Additional fever symptoms in babies and children may include:Lack of appetite  not eating and drinking well.Earache or pulling at their ears.High-pitched crying.Fussiness.Paleness or flushness.Excessive thirst.Decreased urination.Possible CausesWhat are the most common causes of fever?A fever has many causes and can be a symptom of almost any illness. Common conditions that cause fever include:Bacterial infections.Viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19.Gastrointestinal (GI) infections.Urinary tract infections.Skin infections.You may also develop a fever due to:A reaction to certain medications.Vaccinations.Autoimmune disorders.Cancer.Can allergies cause fever?Allergies can cause cold-like symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes, but they typically dont cause fever. Despite its name, hay fever (also called allergic rhinitis) doesnt cause fever.AdvertisementCare and TreatmentWhats the best way to measure body temperature?You can take your temperature in several different parts of your body. The most common site is your mouth (oral temperature). Other sites include your ear (tympanic membrane), forehead (temporal artery) and armpit (axillary). The most accurate site is the rectum, and the least accurate site is the armpit.The best way to measure your temperature is with a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers contain mercury and providers no longer recommend them.How can I break a fever at home?If your fever is mild  less than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C)  you usually dont need treatment with medication. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. Taking a lukewarm bath  about 98 degrees F (36.7 degrees C)  may also help bring your bodys temperature down. Keep an eye on signs of dehydration and other worsening symptoms.If youre feeling uncomfortable and your temperature is higher than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C), you can try to break the fever. The most common way to get rid of a fever is to use over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.Dont give aspirin to children under the age of 17. Aspirin in children may cause Reyes syndrome, a sometimes fatal illness.Does ibuprofen reduce fever?Yes, you can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen to try to reduce a fever.How long does a fever last?The cause of the fever determines how long itll last. Typically, if an infection is the cause of your fever, it should pass within three to four days. Call your healthcare provider if the fever lingers longer than that or comes along with breathing changes.AdvertisementCan fevers be prevented?You can prevent some fevers by avoiding the illnesses and infections that cause them. Sometimes, children develop fevers after receiving vaccinations. You can prevent these types of fevers by giving your child acetaminophen just before or after the vaccination. But you cant prevent most fevers. Theyre typically a sign that your body is doing what its supposed to do.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentWhen To Call the DoctorWhen should a fever be treated by a healthcare provider?In adults, fevers less than 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) typically arent dangerous and arent a cause for concern. If your fever rises above that level, make a call to your healthcare provider for treatment.In children, call your childs healthcare provider if:Their fever lasts more than five days.Their fever is higher than 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen dont break the fever.Youre concerned they arent behaving normally.They have any problems breathing or urinating.When should I go to the ER?If you have a fever along with any of the following symptoms, go to your nearest emergency room or call 911. It may be a sign of a serious or life-threatening illness.Pain or tenderness in your belly (abdomen).Nausea or vomiting.Severe headache.Stiff neck.Light irritates your eyes (photophobia).Convulsions or seizures.Difficulty breathing.Strange behavior and/or altered speech.Confusion or irritability.Difficulty waking or extreme sleepiness.Fever rash (small bleeding spots under your skin).When should I take my child to the ER?If your baby has a fever and is under 3 months of age, take them to the ER right away. Your babys immune system hasnt developed fully yet, and they could have a serious infection.If your child has a fever along with any of the following symptoms, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room:Extreme sluggishness or drowsiness.Lack of appetite.Excessive drooling or difficulty swallowing.Continuous crying.Stiff neck.Fever rash.Difficulty breathing.Severe abdominal pain.Redness or swelling.Dehydration (not drinking many fluids).Decreased urination.What are the possible complications or risks of not treating a fever?Untreated fevers above 105.8 degrees F (41 degrees C) can be dangerous. If your body temperature reaches this level, your organs will begin to malfunction and will eventually fail.Even moderate fevers can be dangerous for adults with lung or heart disorders because fever causes your breathing rate and heart rate to increase. Fever can also worsen the mental state of people with dementia.Additional Common QuestionsWhat is a recurrent fever?A recurrent fever is a fever that keeps coming back multiple times over a period of time. Providers call these fevers episodic because they come and go. The fever lasts for a few days and then goes away for a stretch of time. Your child is healthy and acts normally between fevers. Recurrent fevers affect young children under the age of 5 most often. Theyre one of the main symptoms of a collection of conditions called periodic fever syndromes.What is a febrile seizure?Some children have a side effect of fevers called febrile seizures. This happens in 2% to 4% of children under the age of 5. Some seizures cause jerking movements, or it may look like your child has passed out. When this happens, put your child on their side and dont put anything in their mouth. Call 911 if the seizure lasts for more than five minutes and/or your childs lips turn blue.If the seizure lasts less than five minutes, notify their healthcare provider and get medical attention right away.What is a fever dream?Fever dreams are vivid, bizarre or unpleasant dreams you may experience when your body temperature rises higher than normal. Researchers dont know the exact cause of fever dreams. But some scientists think fevers cause your brain to overheat, affecting your cognitive processing, which results in dreams stranger than your typical dreams. Fevers may also interrupt your REM sleep cycle, which can lead to unusual dreams.A note from Cleveland ClinicWhile a fever can be uncomfortable, its typically a sign that your body is working properly and your immune system is kicking into action. You dont need to treat low fevers, but you can take over-the-counter pain relievers until they pass. If you or your child has a higher temperature or your fever hasnt passed within a few days, you should make a call to your healthcare provider. While infections most often cause fevers, there could be other underlying conditions youll want to get checked out.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 05/31/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm  or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs)  also known as your body's "thermostat"  monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children.

Most providers say a fever is either 100.0 F (37.8 C) or 100.4 F (38 C). When you have a fever, its your bodys normal response to fighting an infection or illness. Fevers usually arent a serious concern. They typically go away when the infection passes.ContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat is a fever?A fever is when your body temperature rises higher than normal. A fever itself isnt an illness. Rather, its a symptom of a wide range of health conditions. When your body temperature rises a few degrees above normal, it can be a sign that your immune system has been activated, often to fight an infection. It can also be a side effect of some medications and vaccinations.What is considered a fever?Common knowledge states that a normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). But your baseline body temperature may vary by a degree or more. It also fluctuates. Its typically lower in the morning and higher in the evening. Its higher during certain points of your menstrual cycle and when youre exercising.Infants and young children normally have slightly higher body temperatures than older children and adults. So infants and younger children have slightly higher fever temperatures.There are no strict guidelines for what temperature is a fever, because body temperature varies by person, time of day and method of measurement. But healthcare providers most often say a fever temperature is 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) when measured orally (by mouth).Rectal and ear thermometers typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) higher than oral thermometers. Skin thermometers (such as forehead thermometers) typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) lower than oral thermometers.What is a low-grade fever?A low-grade fever means a body temperature slightly above normal. This type of fever can be a sign your immune system has been mildly activated. Theres no standard low-grade fever range. But many healthcare providers consider a body temperature between 99.5 degrees F (37.5 degrees C) and 100.3 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) to be a low-grade fever.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat are fever symptoms?In addition to an elevated temperature, you may experience the following symptoms:Chills, feeling cold, shivering and shaking.Body aches and headaches.Fatigue (tiredness).On and off or constant sweating.Flushed complexion or hot skin.Faster heart beats.Additional fever symptoms in babies and children may include:Lack of appetite  not eating and drinking well.Earache or pulling at their ears.High-pitched crying.Fussiness.Paleness or flushness.Excessive thirst.Decreased urination.Possible CausesWhat are the most common causes of fever?A fever has many causes and can be a symptom of almost any illness. Common conditions that cause fever include:Bacterial infections.Viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19.Gastrointestinal (GI) infections.Urinary tract infections.Skin infections.You may also develop a fever due to:A reaction to certain medications.Vaccinations.Autoimmune disorders.Cancer.Can allergies cause fever?Allergies can cause cold-like symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes, but they typically dont cause fever. Despite its name, hay fever (also called allergic rhinitis) doesnt cause fever.AdvertisementCare and TreatmentWhats the best way to measure body temperature?You can take your temperature in several different parts of your body. The most common site is your mouth (oral temperature). Other sites include your ear (tympanic membrane), forehead (temporal artery) and armpit (axillary). The most accurate site is the rectum, and the least accurate site is the armpit.The best way to measure your temperature is with a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers contain mercury and providers no longer recommend them.How can I break a fever at home?If your fever is mild  less than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C)  you usually dont need treatment with medication. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. Taking a lukewarm bath  about 98 degrees F (36.7 degrees C)  may also help bring your bodys temperature down. Keep an eye on signs of dehydration and other worsening symptoms.If youre feeling uncomfortable and your temperature is higher than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C), you can try to break the fever. The most common way to get rid of a fever is to use over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.Dont give aspirin to children under the age of 17. Aspirin in children may cause Reyes syndrome, a sometimes fatal illness.Does ibuprofen reduce fever?Yes, you can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen to try to reduce a fever.How long does a fever last?The cause of the fever determines how long itll last. Typically, if an infection is the cause of your fever, it should pass within three to four days. Call your healthcare provider if the fever lingers longer than that or comes along with breathing changes.AdvertisementCan fevers be prevented?You can prevent some fevers by avoiding the illnesses and infections that cause them. Sometimes, children develop fevers after receiving vaccinations. You can prevent these types of fevers by giving your child acetaminophen just before or after the vaccination. But you cant prevent most fevers. Theyre typically a sign that your body is doing what its supposed to do.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentWhen To Call the DoctorWhen should a fever be treated by a healthcare provider?In adults, fevers less than 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) typically arent dangerous and arent a cause for concern. If your fever rises above that level, make a call to your healthcare provider for treatment.In children, call your childs healthcare provider if:Their fever lasts more than five days.Their fever is higher than 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen dont break the fever.Youre concerned they arent behaving normally.They have any problems breathing or urinating.When should I go to the ER?If you have a fever along with any of the following symptoms, go to your nearest emergency room or call 911. It may be a sign of a serious or life-threatening illness.Pain or tenderness in your belly (abdomen).Nausea or vomiting.Severe headache.Stiff neck.Light irritates your eyes (photophobia).Convulsions or seizures.Difficulty breathing.Strange behavior and/or altered speech.Confusion or irritability.Difficulty waking or extreme sleepiness.Fever rash (small bleeding spots under your skin).When should I take my child to the ER?If your baby has a fever and is under 3 months of age, take them to the ER right away. Your babys immune system hasnt developed fully yet, and they could have a serious infection.If your child has a fever along with any of the following symptoms, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room:Extreme sluggishness or drowsiness.Lack of appetite.Excessive drooling or difficulty swallowing.Continuous crying.Stiff neck.Fever rash.Difficulty breathing.Severe abdominal pain.Redness or swelling.Dehydration (not drinking many fluids).Decreased urination.What are the possible complications or risks of not treating a fever?Untreated fevers above 105.8 degrees F (41 degrees C) can be dangerous. If your body temperature reaches this level, your organs will begin to malfunction and will eventually fail.Even moderate fevers can be dangerous for adults with lung or heart disorders because fever causes your breathing rate and heart rate to increase. Fever can also worsen the mental state of people with dementia.Additional Common QuestionsWhat is a recurrent fever?A recurrent fever is a fever that keeps coming back multiple times over a period of time. Providers call these fevers episodic because they come and go. The fever lasts for a few days and then goes away for a stretch of time. Your child is healthy and acts normally between fevers. Recurrent fevers affect young children under the age of 5 most often. Theyre one of the main symptoms of a collection of conditions called periodic fever syndromes.What is a febrile seizure?Some children have a side effect of fevers called febrile seizures. This happens in 2% to 4% of children under the age of 5. Some seizures cause jerking movements, or it may look like your child has passed out. When this happens, put your child on their side and dont put anything in their mouth. Call 911 if the seizure lasts for more than five minutes and/or your childs lips turn blue.If the seizure lasts less than five minutes, notify their healthcare provider and get medical attention right away.What is a fever dream?Fever dreams are vivid, bizarre or unpleasant dreams you may experience when your body temperature rises higher than normal. Researchers dont know the exact cause of fever dreams. But some scientists think fevers cause your brain to overheat, affecting your cognitive processing, which results in dreams stranger than your typical dreams. Fevers may also interrupt your REM sleep cycle, which can lead to unusual dreams.A note from Cleveland ClinicWhile a fever can be uncomfortable, its typically a sign that your body is working properly and your immune system is kicking into action. You dont need to treat low fevers, but you can take over-the-counter pain relievers until they pass. If you or your child has a higher temperature or your fever hasnt passed within a few days, you should make a call to your healthcare provider. While infections most often cause fevers, there could be other underlying conditions youll want to get checked out.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 05/31/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Where to get help About fever Fever is a rise in body temperature above the normal temperature, usually caused by infection. Normal body temperature is around 37°C (give or take a degree, but this can vary from person to person). There may also be minor fluctuations over the course of the day and night. The fever triggered by a viral or bacterial infection is caused by chemicals produced by the immune system, which reset the bodys thermostat to a higher level. Contrary to popular belief, the severity of fever isnt necessarily related to the seriousness of the illness  for example, life-threatening meningitis might only cause a small temperature rise. Most cases of mild fever resolve by themselves within a couple of days. A mild fever (up to 39°C) can actually help the immune system to get rid of an infection. In children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years, fever can trigger convulsions. A fever of 42.4°C or higher, particularly in the elderly, can permanently damage the brain. Symptoms of fever The symptoms of fever can include: feeling unwell feeling hot and sweaty shivering or shaking chattering teeth flushed face. Infection is usually the cause of fever The cause of fever is usually an infection of some kind. This could include: diseases caused by viruses  such as colds, flu, COVID-19 or other upper respiratory tract infections diseases caused by bacteria  such as tonsillitis, pneumonia or urinary tract infections some chronic illnesses  such as rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis can cause fevers that last for longer periods some tropical diseases  such as malaria, which can cause bouts of recurring fever or typhoid fever heat stroke  which includes fever (without sweating) as one of its symptoms drugs  some people may be susceptible to fever as a side effect of particular drugs. Self-treatment suggestions for fever Suggestions to treat fever include: Take paracetamol or ibuprofen in appropriate doses to help bring your temperature down. Drink plenty of fluids, particularly water. Avoid alcohol, tea and coffee as these drinks can cause slight dehydration. Sponge exposed skin with tepid water. To boost the cooling effect of evaporation, you could try standing in front of a fan. Avoid taking cold baths or showers. Skin reacts to the cold by constricting its blood vessels, which will trap body heat. The cold may also cause shivering, which can generate more heat. Make sure you have plenty of rest, including bed rest. When to see your doctor for fever symptoms You should always consult with your doctor in the following cases: You are still feverish after 3 days, despite home treatment. Your temperature is over 40°C. You are shivering and shaking involuntarily, or your teeth are chattering. You seem to be getting sicker as time goes by. You have unusual symptoms such as hallucinations, vomiting, neck stiffness, skin rash, rapid heart rate, chills or muscle spasms. You feel confused and drowsy. You have a severe headache that doesnt respond to painkillers. You have recently travelled overseas. When to seek immediate urgent medical attention You should seek immediate medical attention if you or someone else has the following symptoms: fever with headache and a stiff neck rash that does not blanche to skin pressure (indicates bleeding into the skin)  this can be a sign of a life-threatening illness. Diagnosis methods Since fever is a symptom and not an illness, the underlying cause must be found before specific treatment can begin. Some tests may be necessary if the cause of the fever is not clear after your doctor has taken a medical history and performed an examination. These tests may include: blood tests urine examination and culture throat swabs or mucus sample examination and culture stool examination and culture x-rays. Treatment options Treatment depends on the cause  for example, chronic tonsillitis may require surgery to remove the tonsils (tonsillectomy). Fevers caused by viral illnesses shouldnt be treated with antibiotics, since these drugs have no effect against viruses. In cases of mild bacterial infection, it is usually best to allow your immune system to handle the problem, rather than take antibiotics. Fever in children On average, a child has up to 10 infections per year. Body temperature isnt a reliable indicator of illness for babies and young children  a child may have a mild temperature according to the thermometer (slightly over 37°C), but seem happy and healthy. See a doctor right away if your child: is aged six months or less has a rash has a fever of 40°C or more is still feverish after a day or so, despite 4-hourly doses of baby paracetamol vomits or has persistent diarrhoea refuses food or drink cries inconsolably seems listless, floppy or just looks ill convulses or twitches has trouble breathing is in pain. If you feel at all worried or concerned at any stage, consult with your doctor. Using a thermometer If you suspect that your child has a fever, you can use a thermometer to measure their temperature. Remember, though, that body temperature is better used as a guide than a reliable indicator of illness for babies and young children  a child might have a mild temperature according to the thermometer (slightly over 37°C), but may seem happy and healthy. There are several types of reliable thermometers available, which come with instructions on how to use them. They are available from a chemist. If you are in doubt about which one to choose for your child, or have questions about how to use it, ask your pharmacist to explain. Treatment for fever in children Dress your child in light clothing. Give drinks of clear fluid (like water). Keep your child cool. Give paracetamol in the correct dose for the childs age (but not more than 4 doses in a 24-hour period). Do not give regular paracetamol medicine for more than 24 hours without seeking advice from your doctor. See your doctor if your child is 3 months or younger. Don't give your child a cold bath. Fever can cause convulsions A febrile convulsion is a fit or seizure that occurs in babies and children when they have a high fever, usually from an ear infection or a viral upper respiratory infection. The fit can last a few seconds or up to 15 minutes, and is followed by drowsiness. Approximately 3% of otherwise healthy children will have one or more febrile convulsions between the ages of 6 months and 6 years. A febrile convulsion is not epilepsy and does not cause brain damage. There is no way to predict who will be affected or when this will happen. The symptoms of febrile convulsion include: loss of consciousness (black out)  the child will fall if standing and may pass urine twitching or jerking of arms and legs breathing difficulty foaming at the mouth going pale or bluish in skin colour eye rolling, so only the whites of their eyes are visible your child may take 15 minutes to wake up properly afterwards  they may be irritable and appear not to recognise you. Convulsions are rarely serious. If your child has a convulsion you should: Try to stay calm and don't panic. Place your child on the floor and remove any objects they could knock against. Dont force anything into your childs mouth. Dont shake, slap or try to restrain your child. Once the convulsion has stopped, roll your child onto their side, also known as the recovery position. If there is food in their mouth, turn their head to the side, and do not try to remove it. Note what time the fit started and stopped, so you can tell the doctor. Have your child checked by your local doctor or nearest hospital emergency department as soon as possible after the fit stops to find the cause of the fever.
Call triple zero (000) for an ambulance if the fit lasts more than 5 minutes.

A fever is a sure sign your body is fighting off some type of infection. (Photo credit: E+/Getty Images)
A fever is when you have a brief rise in body temperature thats higher than your normal body temperature. Its also called a high temperature, hyperthermia, or pyrexia. It's usually a sign your immune system is working to fight some type of infection. Fever temperaturesNormal body temperatures are different for everyone, but they usually fall within the range of 97 to 99 degrees F. A temperature of 100.4 or higher is considered a fever, but there is no medical standard. The type of thermometer you use affects the temperature you get, as some are more accurate than others. Here's a breakdown of what's considered a fever by age and temperature: Babies age 0-2 years100.4 F (rectal, forehead, or ear temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature)Children ages 2-5 years100.4 F (rectal, forehead, or ear temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature)Children ages 5 and older100.4 F (ear temperature)100 F (oral temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature) Adults100.4 F (oral temperature)A low-grade fever is when you have a temperature that is slightly higher than normal, usually around 99.5 to 100.3 F. A low-grade fever signals that something is going on to activate your immune system.When Is Fever Dangerous?A fever can make you uncomfortable, but it's generally not cause for concern. You can often manage a fever at home, but in some cases you should call your doctor. Fever in babies: When to worryCheck in with your doctor if your baby younger than 3 months:Has a rectal temperature higher than 100.4 F. Has fever higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Has other symptoms, such as a cough or diarrhea.Call 911 or go to the ER if your baby has a seizure.Check in with your doctor if your baby 3 to 6 months old: Has a rectal or oral temperature higher than 100.4 F and is also irritable or sleepy.Has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Call your doctor or go to the ER if your baby won't stop crying and cant be consoled.  Fever in children: When to worryYou should reach out to your pediatrician if your child 6 months to 2 years:Has a fever higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Has other symptoms, such as a cough or diarrhea.If their fever comes with rash, real discomfort, irritability, low energy, headache, stiff neck, or repeated diarrhea or vomiting.Their fever is higher than 104 F, which can cause a seizure.Call 911 or go to the ER if your child has a seizure.Their fever doesnt go down after taking over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen.They've recently had vaccines.Fever in adults: When to worryCall your doctor or visit urgent care or an emergency room if:You have a temperature of 103 F or higher.Your fever doesnt go down after taking over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen.Youve been in contact with someone who has COVID-19.If you have a fever that is 102 degrees or higher, especially if you're in your first trimester of pregnancy. When to call the doctorCall 911 if you or your child have any of these symptoms:UnresponsiveWheezing or difficulty breathingBlue lipsConvulsions or seizuresSpeaking in a confused way A fever with a stiff neck or headacheTemperature higher than 105 FFever with sudden onset of rashSevere stomach pain or persistent vomitingSkin rashes, blisters, or a red streak on an arm or legA severe sore throat, swelling of the throat, or earachePain with urination (peeing), back pain, or shaking chillsA serious cough, or coughing up bloodContact your doctor if your fever lasts for more than 3 days or gets worse.Fever SymptomsA fever is a sign of an illness or infection. When you have one, you may notice these symptoms:Chills or shiveringSweatingBody achesHeadacheLethargy (feeling weak)Being irritableLoss of appetiteDehydrationRed or flushed faceBabies and children might also have:Earache (or pulling at their ears)High-pitch criesLoss of appetiteExtra thirstLow urine output (peeing less than usual)What Causes Fever?A fever can be a sign of several health conditions, which may or may not need medical treatment.The most common causes are infections such as colds and stomach bugs (gastroenteritis). Other causes include:Infections of the ear, lung, skin, throat, bladder, or kidneyHeat exhaustionViral infections like the flu or COVID-19SunburnConditions that cause inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritisSide effects of medicationsVaccines and immunizationsBlood clotsAutoimmune conditions such as lupus and inflammatory bowel disease (IBS)CancerHormone disorders such as hyperthyroidismIllegal drugs such as amphetamines and cocaineTeething in babies can cause a mild, low-grade fever (not over 101 degrees).Fever DiagnosisAlthough a fever is easy to measure with a thermometer, finding its cause can be hard. If you see your doctor, they'll do a physical exam and ask questions about your symptoms, other health conditions you have, medications you take, and if you've recently traveled to areas that have health risks. A malaria infection, for example, may cause a high fever that gets better and then comes back in cycles. Some areas of the U.S. are hot spots for infections such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Your doctor may ask if you have been around someone with COVID-19 or have any other symptoms of COVID-19.Sometimes, you may have a "fever of unknown origin." That means whatever's causing your fever isn't clear. Instead, it could be more unusual like a connective tissue disorder (diseases that affect things like your tendons, ligaments, skin, or cartilage), cancer, or another health problem. Your doctor may need to run tests to figure out the cause.Fever TreatmentsThe most common treatments for fever include over-the-counter drugs such as acetaminophen  and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen. Talk to your doctor about the proper dosage. Never give young children and teens aspirin. It's linked to a rare condition called Reyes syndrome that could damage their liver and brain.What is the best way to treat a fever at home?Drink a lot of clear liquids such as water, broth, and juices. Take a lukewarm bath. Do not use cold water or alcohol.Get plenty of rest. Keep yourself cool with lightweight clothing and bed coverings.If you get the chills, use an extra blanket until they go away.Types of FeverFevers have a wide range of causes, and you might hear your doctor call your fever a certain name. That's because doctors classify five types of fevers based on their patterns.Intermittent. With this type of fever, your temperature rises, but falls back to a normal range during the day. The difference can range from a small increase to about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Remittent. This type of fever rises and falls, but your temperature always stays above normal. Continuous or sustained. Your temperature stays about the same throughout the day. Hectic. This causes big swings in temperature, about 2 degrees F or more, throughout the day. You may also have symptoms like chills and sweats. Relapsing. A relapsing fever spikes after a few days or even weeks of normal temperature. Fever ComplicationsMost fevers get better without any problems, but some can have rare complications, especially in young children.If your child is aged 6 months to 5 years, a fever could put them at risk of a febrile seizure. They usually occur when your child's fever is higher than 100.4 F.  Signs your child could be having a febrile seizure include: They lose consciousness.Their arms and legs shake.Stiff or twitching one side of their body.Febrile seizures usually happen within the first 24 hours of your child's fever, and they might be the first sign your child is sick. Call 911 or your doctor immediately, even if the seizure lasts just a few seconds.  Sources

Bush, MD, FACP, Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, Florida Atlantic
UniversityReviewed/Revised Jul 2024VIEW PROFESSIONAL VERSIONGET THE QUICK FACTSCauses|Evaluation|Treatment|Essentials for Older People|Key Points|Fever is an elevated body temperature that occurs when the body's thermostat (located in the hypothalamus in the brain) resets at a higher temperature, primarily in response to an infection. Elevated body temperature that is not caused by a resetting of the temperature set point is called hyperthermia. Although 98.6° F (37° C) is considered normal temperature, body temperature varies throughout the day. It is lowest in the early morning and highest in the late afternoonsometimes reaching 99.9° F (37.7° C). Similarly, a fever does not stay at a constant temperature. Sometimes temperature peaks every day and then returns to normal. This process is called intermittent fever. Alternatively, temperature varies but does not return to normal. This process is called remittent fever. Doctors no longer think that the pattern of the rise and fall of fever is very important in the diagnosis of certain disorders.Body temperature can be measured at several areas of the body. The most common sites are the mouth (oral temperature) and rectum (rectal temperature). Other sites include the ear, forehead, and, much less preferably, armpit. Temperature is typically measured using a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers containing mercury are not recommended because they can break and expose people to mercury.Oral temperatures are considered elevated whenThey are higher than 99° F (37° C) in the early morning.They are higher than 100.4° F (38° C) at any time after the early morning.They are higher than a persons known normal everyday temperature.Rectal and ear temperatures are about 1.0° F (0.6° C) higher than oral temperatures. Skin temperatures (for example, the forehead) are about 1.0° F (0.6° C) lower than oral temperatures. Many people use the term fever loosely, often meaning that they feel too warm, too cold, or sweaty, but they have not actually measured their temperature.The ability to generate a fever is reduced in certain people (for example, those who are very old, very young, or who have an alcohol use disorder).(See also Overview of Infectious Disease and Fever in Infants and Children.)Consequences of feverThe symptoms people have are due mainly to the condition causing the fever rather than the fever itself.Although many people worry that fever can cause harm, the typical temporary elevations in body temperature ranging from 100.4° to 104° F (38° to 40° C) caused by most short-lived (acute) infections are well-tolerated by healthy adults. As one of the body's defenses against an infection, a fever can trigger the production of antibodies and make it more difficult for microorganisms to grow, and may lessen the severity of an infection and help it go away. However, a moderate fever may be slightly dangerous for adults with a heart or lung disorder because fever causes the heart rate and breathing rate to increase. Fever can also worsen mental status in people with dementia.Additionally, an extreme temperature elevation (typically more than 105.8° F, or 41° C) may be damaging. A body temperature this high can cause malfunction and ultimately failure of most organs. Such extreme elevation sometimes results from very severe infection (such as sepsis, malaria, or meningitis) but is more typically caused by heatstroke or use of certain illicit drugs (such as
or PCP).Fever in healthy children can cause febrile seizures.Causes of Fever in AdultsSubstances that cause fever are called pyrogens. Pyrogens can come from inside or outside the body. Microorganisms and the substances they produce (such as toxins) are examples of pyrogens formed outside the body. Pyrogens formed inside the body are usually produced by 2 types of white blood cells called monocytes and macrophages. Pyrogens from outside the body can cause fever by stimulating the body to release its own pyrogens or by directly affecting the area of the brain that controls temperature.Many disorders can cause fever. They are broadly categorized asInfectious (most common)Neoplastic (cancer)Inflammatory (including autoimmune disorders, allergic reactions, and some drug reactions)An infectious cause is highly likely in adults with a fever that lasts 4 days or less (called an acute fever). An acute fever in people with cancer or a known inflammatory disorder also is most likely to have an infectious cause. In healthy people, an acute fever is unlikely to be the first sign of a chronic illness. A noninfectious cause is more likely to cause fever that lasts a long time or returns. Infectious causesInfections are the most common causes of fever. Infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Virtually all infections can cause fever, but, overall, the most likely infectious causes are the following:Upper and lower respiratory tract infectionsGastrointestinal infectionsUrinary tract infections (UTIs)Skin infectionsMost acute respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections are viral.Neoplastic causesMany cancers cause fever, for example, leukemia, lymphoma, and kidney cancer. Inflammatory causesInflammatory disorders that cause fever include systemic rheumatic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), and giant cell arteritis. Fever may also result from an allergic reaction.Medications and drugs sometimes cause fever. For example, beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin) and sulfa medications can trigger a fever. Certain illicit drugs (such as , amphetamines, or phencyclidine) and medications such as anesthetics and antipsychotics can cause an extremely high temperature.Risk factorsCertain factors help doctors determine what is the most likely cause of fever in a person. These factors include the following:The person's health status, age, and occupationHospitalizationUse of certain medications or illicit drugsExposure to infections (for example, through travel or contact with infected people, animals, or insects)Table Some Causes of Fever Based on Risk FactorsRisk FactorCauseNone (healthy)Upper or lower respiratory tract infectionGastrointestinal infectionUrinary tract infectionSkin infectionHospitalizationBloodstream infection related to a catheter inserted in a vein (IV catheter infection)Urinary tract infection, particularly in people with a urinary catheterPneumonia, particularly in people on a ventilatorAtelectasis (collapse of part of a lung due to an airway blockage, rather than an infection)Infection or a pocket of blood (hematoma) at the site of surgeryDeep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolismDiarrhea (due to Clostridioides difficileinduced colitis)MedicationsTransfusion reactionPressure soresTravel to areas where an infection is common (endemic areas)MalariaViral hepatitisDisorders that cause diarrheaTyphoid feverZika virus, chikungunya, Ebola virus, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, measles, and yellow feverDengue feverFungal infections such as coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, or histoplasmosisRickettsial infections (such as African tick-bite fever and Mediterranean spotted fever)Exposure to insects or animals that carry disease-causing organisms, called vectors (in the United States)Ticks: Rickettsiosis, ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, babesiosis, relapsing fever, or tularemiaMosquitoes: Encephalitis caused by arboviruses, malaria, or Zika virus infection; yellow feverWild animals: Tularemia, rabies, or hantavirus infectionFleas: PlagueDomestic animals: Brucellosis, cat-scratch disease, Q fever, or toxoplasmosisBirds: Psittacosis, bird fluReptiles: Salmonella infectionBats: Rabies or histoplasmosisA weakened immune system (immunocompromise)Viruses: Varicella-zoster virus infection or cytomegalovirus infectionBacteria: Infection due to pneumococci, meningococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Nocardia, or mycobacteriaFungi: Infection due to Candida, Aspergillus, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, microsporidia, Pneumocystis jirovecii, or fungi that cause mucormycosisParasites: Infection due to Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Cryptosporidium, or Cystoisospora belliMedications and illicit drugs that can alter body temperatureAmphetaminesPhencyclidine (PCP)Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or Ecstasy)Antipsychotic medications (can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome)Anesthetics (inhaled anesthetic gases such as halothane can cause malignant hyperthermia)ThyroxineInterferons (medications that are based on substances produced by the immune system and that help block the reproduction of viruses)Medications that can trigger fever by a hypersensitivity (allergic) reactionBeta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin)Sulfa drugsPhenytoinCarbamazepineProcainamideQuinidineEvaluation of Fever in AdultsUsually, a doctor can determine that an infection is present based on a brief history, a physical examination, and occasionally a few simple tests, such as a chest x-ray and urine tests. However, sometimes the cause of fever is not readily identified.When doctors initially evaluate people with an acute fever, they focus on 2 general issues:Identifying other symptoms such as headache or cough: These symptoms help narrow the range of possible causes.Determining whether the person is seriously or chronically ill: Many of the possible acute viral infections go away on their own and also are difficult for doctors to diagnose specifically (that is, to determine exactly which virus is causing the infection). Limiting testing to people who are seriously or chronically ill can help avoid many expensive, unnecessary, and often fruitless searches.Warning signsIn people with an acute fever, certain signs and characteristics are cause for concern. They includeA change in mental function, such as confusionA headache, stiff neck, or bothFlat, small, purplish red spots on the skin (petechiae), which indicate bleeding under the skinLow blood pressureRapid heart rate or rapid breathingShortness of breath (dyspnea)A temperature that is higher than 104° F (40° C) or lower than 95° F (35° C)Recent travel to an area where a serious infectious disease such as malaria is commonRecent use of medications that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants)When to see a doctorPeople who have any warning signs should see a doctor right away. Such people typically need immediate testing and often admission to a hospital.People without warning signs should call the doctor if the fever lasts more than 24 to 48 hours. Depending on the person's age, other symptoms, and known medical conditions, the doctor may ask the person to come for evaluation or recommend treatment at home. Typically, people should see a doctor if a fever lasts more than 3 or 4 days regardless of other symptoms.What the doctor doesDoctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history. Doctors then do a physical examination. What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the fever and the tests that may need to be done.A doctor begins by asking a person about present and previous symptoms and disorders, medications currently being taken, any blood transfusions, exposure to infections, recent travel, vaccinations, and recent hospitalizations, surgeries, or other medical procedures. The pattern of the fever rarely helps the doctor make a diagnosis. However, a fever that returns every other day or every third day is typical of malaria. Doctors consider malaria and other insect-transmitted infections as a possible cause only if people have traveled to an area where the infection is common.Recent travel may give the doctor clues as to the cause of a fever because some infections occur in certain areas. For example, coccidioidomycosis (a fungal infection) occurs mostly in the southwestern United States.Recent exposures are also important. For example, people who work in a meatpacking plant are more likely to develop brucellosis (a bacterial infection spread through contact with domestic animals). Other examples include unsafe water or food (such as unpasteurized milk and milk products, and raw or undercooked meat, fish, and shellfish), insect (such as mosquitoes) and tick bites, unprotected sex, and occupational or recreational exposures (such as hunting, hiking, and water sports).Pain is an important clue to the possible source of fever, so the doctor asks about any pain in the ears, head, neck, teeth, throat, chest, abdomen, flank, rectum, muscles, and joints.Other symptoms that help determine the cause of the fever include nasal congestion and/or discharge, cough, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency, and pain while urinating). Knowing whether the person has enlarged lymph nodes or a rash (including what it looks like, where it is, and when it appeared in relation to other symptoms) may help the doctor pinpoint a cause. People with recurring fevers, night sweats, and weight loss may have a chronic infection such as tuberculosis or endocarditis (infection of the heart's lining and usually the heart valves).The doctor may also ask about the following:Contact with anyone who has an infectionAny known conditions that predispose to infection, such as HIV infection, diabetes, cancer, organ transplantation, sickle cell disease, use of an artificial pacemaker, or heart valve disorders, particularly if an artificial valve is presentAny known disorders that may cause a fever without infection, such as lupus, gout, sarcoidosis, an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), or cancerUse of any medications that may make a person susceptible to infection, such as cancer chemotherapy, corticosteroids, or other medications that suppress the immune systemUse of illicit drugs that are injectedThe physical examination begins with confirmation of fever. Fever is most accurately determined by measuring rectal temperature, but oral or ear temperature is often measured. Forehead temperature is not as accurate as rectal, but doctors may measure forehead temperature to screen people for fever. Armpit temperature is the least accurate, so doctors rarely use it to confirm a fever. Doctors then do a thorough examination from head to toe to check for a source of infection or evidence of disease.TestingThe need for testing depends on what the doctor finds during the medical history and physical examination.Otherwise healthy people who have an acute fever and only vague, general symptoms (for example, they feel generally ill or achy) probably have a viral illness that will go away without treatment. Therefore, they do not usually require testing. Exceptions are people who are in an area where COVID-19 is being spread, people who have been exposed to an animal or insect that carries and transmits a specific disease (called a vector), such as people with a tick bite, and people who have recently been in an area where a particular disorder (such as malaria) is common.If otherwise healthy people have findings that suggest a particular disorder, testing may be needed. Doctors select tests based on those findings. For example, if people have a headache and stiff neck, a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) is done to look for meningitis. If people have a cough and lung congestion, a chest x-ray is done to look for pneumonia. For certain respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19 or influenza, there are rapid molecular tests that can give results within minutes or a few hours. Some rapid tests can be done at home or in a doctor's office on a sample obtained with a cotton swab. Other rapid tests to identify a specific cause of an infection require a blood sample sent to a laboratory.People who are at increased risk of infection, people who appear seriously ill, and older adults often need testing even when findings do not suggest a particular disorder. For such people, doctors may do the following:A complete blood count (including the number and proportion of different types of white blood cells)Urine and blood culturesA chest x-rayUrinalysisLab TestComplete Blood CountLab TestUrinalysisAn increase in the white blood cell count usually indicates infection. The proportion of different types of white blood cells (differential count) gives further clues. For example, an increase in neutrophils suggests a relatively new bacterial infection. An increase in eosinophils suggests the presence of parasites, such as tapeworms or roundworms. Also, blood, urine, and other body fluids may be sent to the laboratory to try to grow the microorganism in a culture. Other blood tests can be used to detect antibodies against specific microorganisms.Fever of unknown origin (FUO)A fever of unknown origin may be diagnosed when People have a fever of at least 101° F (38.3° C) for several weeks.Extensive investigation does not detect a cause.In such cases, the cause may be an unusual chronic infection (such as tuberculosis, bacterial infection of the heart, HIV infection, cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus) or something other than an infection, such as a systemic rheumatic disorder (such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis) or cancer (such as lymphoma, ovarian cancer, or leukemia). Other causes include medication or illicit drug reactions, blood clots (deep vein thrombosis), inflammation of organ tissues (sarcoidosis), and inflammatory bowel disease.In older adults, the most common causes of FUO are giant cell arteritis, lymphomas, abscesses, and tuberculosis.Doctors usually do blood tests, including a complete blood count, blood cultures, liver blood tests, and tests to check for systemic rheumatic disorders. Other tests, such as chest x-ray, urinalysis, and urine culture, may be done.Lab TestBacteria Culture TestUltrasound studies, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly of areas that are causing discomfort, may help a doctor diagnose the cause. Radionuclide scanning, done after white blood cells labeled with a radioactive marker are injected into a vein, or positron emission tomography (PET) may be used to identify areas of infection or inflammation.If these test results are negative, doctors may need to take a sample of tissue from the liver, bone marrow, or another site of suspected infection for biopsy. The sample is then examined under a microscope, cultured, and analyzed.The treatment of FUO is focused on treating the disorder causing the fever if it is known. Doctors may give medications to lower the body temperature (see treatment of fever).Treatment of Fever in AdultsThe best fever treatment is treatment of the cause.Because fever helps the body defend against infection and because fever itself is not dangerous (unless it is higher than about 106° F [41° C]), there is some debate as to whether fever should be routinely treated. However, people with a high fever generally feel much better when the fever is treated. Plus, people with a heart or lung disorder and those with dementia are considered to be at particular risk of dangerous complications, so when they have a fever, it should be treated.Medications used to lower body temperature are called antipyretics.Because many over-the-counter cold or flu preparations contain acetaminophen, people must be careful not to take acetaminophen and one or more of these cold or flu preparations at the same time.Other cooling measures (such as cooling with a tepid water mist and using cooling blankets) are needed only if the temperature is about 106° F (41.1° C) or higher. People should not apply rubbing alcohol to their skin with a washcloth or sponge because alcohol can be absorbed through the skin and may have harmful effects.People who have a blood infection (bacteremia) or who have abnormal vital signs (such as low blood pressure and a rapid pulse and breathing rate) are admitted to the hospital.Essentials for Older People: FeverFever can be tricky in older people because the body may not respond the way it would in younger people. For example, in frail older adults, infection is less likely to cause fever. Even when elevated by infection, the temperature may be lower than the standard definition of fever, and the degree of fever may not correspond to the severity of the illness. Similarly, other symptoms, such as pain, may be less noticeable. Frequently, a change in mental function or a decline in daily functioning is the only other initial sign of pneumonia or a urinary tract infection.However, older adults with a fever are more likely to have a serious bacterial infection than are younger adults with a fever. As in younger adults, the cause is commonly a respiratory or urinary tract infection. Skin and soft-tissue infections are also common causes of fever in older adults. Older adults are more likely to have serious manifestations of respiratory viral infections such as influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Diagnosis of fever in older adults is similar to that for younger adults, except that for older adults, doctors usually recommend urine tests (including culture) and a chest x-ray. Samples of blood are cultured to rule out a blood infection (bacteremia).Key PointsMost fevers in healthy people are caused by a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection due to a virus.If people with a fever have any warning signs, they should see a doctor right away.Doctors can usually identify an infection based on a brief medical history, a physical examination, and occasionally a few simple tests, and then doctors use these results, particularly symptoms, to determine which other tests are needed.Doctors consider underlying chronic disorders, particularly those that impair the immune system, as a possible cause of fever that lasts a long time.In older adults, infections are less likely to cause fever, and other symptoms may be less noticeable.Test your KnowledgeTake a Quiz!

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm  or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs)  also known as your body's "thermostat"  monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children.

Most providers say a fever is either 100.0 F (37.8 C) or 100.4 F (38 C). When you have a fever, its your bodys normal response to fighting an infection or illness. Fevers usually arent a serious concern. They typically go away when the infection passes.ContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat is a fever?A fever is when your body temperature rises higher than normal. A fever itself isnt an illness. Rather, its a symptom of a wide range of health conditions. When your body temperature rises a few degrees above normal, it can be a sign that your immune system has been activated, often to fight an infection. It can also be a side effect of some medications and vaccinations.What is considered a fever?Common knowledge states that a normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). But your baseline body temperature may vary by a degree or more. It also fluctuates. Its typically lower in the morning and higher in the evening. Its higher during certain points of your menstrual cycle and when youre exercising.Infants and young children normally have slightly higher body temperatures than older children and adults. So infants and younger children have slightly higher fever temperatures.There are no strict guidelines for what temperature is a fever, because body temperature varies by person, time of day and method of measurement. But healthcare providers most often say a fever temperature is 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) when measured orally (by mouth).Rectal and ear thermometers typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) higher than oral thermometers. Skin thermometers (such as forehead thermometers) typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) lower than oral thermometers.What is a low-grade fever?A low-grade fever means a body temperature slightly above normal. This type of fever can be a sign your immune system has been mildly activated. Theres no standard low-grade fever range. But many healthcare providers consider a body temperature between 99.5 degrees F (37.5 degrees C) and 100.3 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) to be a low-grade fever.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat are fever symptoms?In addition to an elevated temperature, you may experience the following symptoms:Chills, feeling cold, shivering and shaking.Body aches and headaches.Fatigue (tiredness).On and off or constant sweating.Flushed complexion or hot skin.Faster heart beats.Additional fever symptoms in babies and children may include:Lack of appetite  not eating and drinking well.Earache or pulling at their ears.High-pitched crying.Fussiness.Paleness or flushness.Excessive thirst.Decreased urination.Possible CausesWhat are the most common causes of fever?A fever has many causes and can be a symptom of almost any illness. Common conditions that cause fever include:Bacterial infections.Viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19.Gastrointestinal (GI) infections.Urinary tract infections.Skin infections.You may also develop a fever due to:A reaction to certain medications.Vaccinations.Autoimmune disorders.Cancer.Can allergies cause fever?Allergies can cause cold-like symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes, but they typically dont cause fever. Despite its name, hay fever (also called allergic rhinitis) doesnt cause fever.AdvertisementCare and TreatmentWhats the best way to measure body temperature?You can take your temperature in several different parts of your body. The most common site is your mouth (oral temperature). Other sites include your ear (tympanic membrane), forehead (temporal artery) and armpit (axillary). The most accurate site is the rectum, and the least accurate site is the armpit.The best way to measure your temperature is with a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers contain mercury and providers no longer recommend them.How can I break a fever at home?If your fever is mild  less than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C)  you usually dont need treatment with medication. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. Taking a lukewarm bath  about 98 degrees F (36.7 degrees C)  may also help bring your bodys temperature down. Keep an eye on signs of dehydration and other worsening symptoms.If youre feeling uncomfortable and your temperature is higher than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C), you can try to break the fever. The most common way to get rid of a fever is to use over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.Dont give aspirin to children under the age of 17. Aspirin in children may cause Reyes syndrome, a sometimes fatal illness.Does ibuprofen reduce fever?Yes, you can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen to try to reduce a fever.How long does a fever last?The cause of the fever determines how long itll last. Typically, if an infection is the cause of your fever, it should pass within three to four days. Call your healthcare provider if the fever lingers longer than that or comes along with breathing changes.AdvertisementCan fevers be prevented?You can prevent some fevers by avoiding the illnesses and infections that cause them. Sometimes, children develop fevers after receiving vaccinations. You can prevent these types of fevers by giving your child acetaminophen just before or after the vaccination. But you cant prevent most fevers. Theyre typically a sign that your body is doing what its supposed to do.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentWhen To Call the DoctorWhen should a fever be treated by a healthcare provider?In adults, fevers less than 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) typically arent dangerous and arent a cause for concern. If your fever rises above that level, make a call to your healthcare provider for treatment.In children, call your childs healthcare provider if:Their fever lasts more than five days.Their fever is higher than 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen dont break the fever.Youre concerned they arent behaving normally.They have any problems breathing or urinating.When should I go to the ER?If you have a fever along with any of the following symptoms, go to your nearest emergency room or call 911. It may be a sign of a serious or life-threatening illness.Pain or tenderness in your belly (abdomen).Nausea or vomiting.Severe headache.Stiff neck.Light irritates your eyes (photophobia).Convulsions or seizures.Difficulty breathing.Strange behavior and/or altered speech.Confusion or irritability.Difficulty waking or extreme sleepiness.Fever rash (small bleeding spots under your skin).When should I take my child to the ER?If your baby has a fever and is under 3 months of age, take them to the ER right away. Your babys immune system hasnt developed fully yet, and they could have a serious infection.If your child has a fever along with any of the following symptoms, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room:Extreme sluggishness or drowsiness.Lack of appetite.Excessive drooling or difficulty swallowing.Continuous crying.Stiff neck.Fever rash.Difficulty breathing.Severe abdominal pain.Redness or swelling.Dehydration (not drinking many fluids).Decreased urination.What are the possible complications or risks of not treating a fever?Untreated fevers above 105.8 degrees F (41 degrees C) can be dangerous. If your body temperature reaches this level, your organs will begin to malfunction and will eventually fail.Even moderate fevers can be dangerous for adults with lung or heart disorders because fever causes your breathing rate and heart rate to increase. Fever can also worsen the mental state of people with dementia.Additional Common QuestionsWhat is a recurrent fever?A recurrent fever is a fever that keeps coming back multiple times over a period of time. Providers call these fevers episodic because they come and go. The fever lasts for a few days and then goes away for a stretch of time. Your child is healthy and acts normally between fevers. Recurrent fevers affect young children under the age of 5 most often. Theyre one of the main symptoms of a collection of conditions called periodic fever syndromes.What is a febrile seizure?Some children have a side effect of fevers called febrile seizures. This happens in 2% to 4% of children under the age of 5. Some seizures cause jerking movements, or it may look like your child has passed out. When this happens, put your child on their side and dont put anything in their mouth. Call 911 if the seizure lasts for more than five minutes and/or your childs lips turn blue.If the seizure lasts less than five minutes, notify their healthcare provider and get medical attention right away.What is a fever dream?Fever dreams are vivid, bizarre or unpleasant dreams you may experience when your body temperature rises higher than normal. Researchers dont know the exact cause of fever dreams. But some scientists think fevers cause your brain to overheat, affecting your cognitive processing, which results in dreams stranger than your typical dreams. Fevers may also interrupt your REM sleep cycle, which can lead to unusual dreams.A note from Cleveland ClinicWhile a fever can be uncomfortable, its typically a sign that your body is working properly and your immune system is kicking into action. You dont need to treat low fevers, but you can take over-the-counter pain relievers until they pass. If you or your child has a higher temperature or your fever hasnt passed within a few days, you should make a call to your healthcare provider. While infections most often cause fevers, there could be other underlying conditions youll want to get checked out.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 05/31/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

It is a common sign of an infection.As a persons body temperature increases, they may feel cold until it levels off and stops rising. People describe this as chills.Eating, exercise, sleeping, the time of day, and individual factors can also affect temperature. When an infection occurs, the immune system will launch an attack to try to remove the cause. A high body temperature is a normal part of this reaction. A fever will usually resolve on its own. However, if body temperature rises too high, it may be a symptom of a severe infection that needs medical treatment. In this case, a doctor may recommend medication to reduce it.Read on to learn more about the symptoms of a fever, as well as some causes and treatment options.SymptomsShare on PinterestA fever is a common sign of an infection.When someone has a fever, they may also:shiver and feel cold when nobody else doessweathave a low appetiteshow signs of dehydrationhave increased sensitivity to painlack energy and feel sleepyhave difficulty concentratingIf a baby has a fever, they may:feel hot to the touchhave flushed cheeksbe sweaty or clammyWith a high fever, there may also be irritability, confusion, delirium, and seizures.COVID-19 symptomsIf a person has a fever with a dry cough, they may have symptoms of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urge people with these symptoms to stay at home and away from other people. The person should also wear a face covering if other people are near.In many cases, the symptoms will improve without specialist treatment. However, if the person also develops severe chest pain or difficulty breathing, they should call 911 and ask for medical help. Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, most people now use a digital thermometer. Experts do not recommend using a glass thermometer, as these can be dangerous. Some people use a forehead strip, but these may be less accurate.A person can put a thermometer under their arm or in their mouth.To use a digital device: Clean the tip using cold water and soap, and then rinse it.Turn on the device.Place the tip under the tongue, toward the back of the mouth, and close the mouth. Or, place it under the armpit and hold the device close to the body.Wait until there is a flash or the thermometer beeps.Read the temperature.Normal armpit temperature will be around 0.5 to 0.9ºF (0.3 to 0.5°C) lower than oral temperature.If the reading is 100.4°F (38°C) or above, the person has a fever. Thermometers are available for purchase over the counter or online.Is it possible to take someones temperature without a thermometer? Find out here.When should I worry?Doctors classify fevers according to how long they last, whether or not they come and go, and how high they are.SeverityCore body temperature varies from person to person.Most experts consider a temperature of 100.4° F (38°C) to be a fever, but in children, this may be lower, at 99.5°F (37.5°C).Hyperpyrexia can occur when a persons temperature rises above 106°F (41.1°C). Without treatment, this can lead to complications.Learn more about normal body temperature and when a person should worry here.DurationA fever can be:acute if it lasts for under 7 dayssubacute if it lasts for up to 14 dayschronic or persistent if it lasts for over 14 daysFevers that exist for days or weeks with no explanation are called fevers of unknown origin.TreatmentA mild fever is part of the immune systems response to bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. It helps the body fight off infection.However, it can be uncomfortable, and a high fever can sometimes lead to complications. For this reason, doctors may sometimes recommend medications called antipyretics to lower a persons temperature.Examples include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can also reduce a fever. Aspirin can help, but it is not suitable for children, and it may not be suitable for people who take blood thinners. NSAIDs and Tylenol are available to purchase over the counter or online.If a person is sweating a lot, they may experience dehydration. In this case, they should consume plenty of fluids to prevent complications.Treating the causeA fever is a symptom, not an illness. A doctor may wish to carry out tests to identify the cause. If the fever is due to a bacterial infection, they may prescribe an antibiotic.If it stems from a viral infection, the doctor may recommend using NSAIDs to relieve the symptoms. Antibiotics will not stop a virus. A doctor will not prescribe them for a viral infection.NSAIDs will not help if the fever is due to hot weather or sustained strenuous exercise. In these cases, it is essential to cool the person down. If they are confused or unconscious, they need immediate medical care.COVID-19A person with symptoms of COVID-19 may not need any medical treatment. However, if they develop severe chest pains and have difficulty breathing, they may need hospital treatment. Some people will need to spend time on a ventilator, which is a device that will help them breathe.CausesFevers can result from various factors, including:an infection, such as strep throat, the flu, chickenpox, pneumonia, or COVID-19rheumatoid arthritissome medicationsoverexposing the skin to sunlight, or sunburnheatstroke, either due to high ambient temperatures or prolonged strenuous exercisedehydrationsilicosis, which is a type of lung disease caused by long-term exposure to silica dustamphetamine abusealcohol withdrawalIn childrenChildren with a high temperature may develop a febrile seizure. These are most likely to occur between the ages of 12 and 18 months.These often result from an ear infection, gastroenteritis, or a respiratory virus, and they are not usually serious. Less commonly, they may stem from a more severe illness, such as meningitis, a kidney infection, or pneumonia.Seizures can occur when the body temperature rises quickly.There are two types of febrile seizure: simple febrile seizures and complex febrile seizures.Simple febrile seizuresThis type of febrile seizure can last from a few seconds up to 15 minutes. However, it usually lasts less than 5 minutes. It does not occur again during a 24-hour period. Around 8085% of febrile seizures are of this type.It typically involves the whole body, and symptoms include:stiffness in the bodytwitching in the arms and legsa loss of consciousness while the eyes stay openThere may also be: irregular breathingurination, defecation, or bothvomitingComplex febrile seizuresThis type of febrile seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes, comes back more often, and tends to affect only a part of the body, rather than the whole body.Complex febrile seizures are more serious than simple febrile seizures. A child who has a complex febrile seizure is more likely to experience epilepsy as they grow older.In fact, around 3040% of children who have either type of seizure will have other similar seizures at a later date.When to see a doctorIn most cases, a child who has a seizure should see a doctor. The doctor may suggest controlling their temperature with acetaminophen and ensuring that they drink plenty of fluids. If necessary, they may also prescribe an anticonvulsant, such as sodium valproate or clonazepam.DiagnosisA fever is a symptom, not an illness. A doctor can diagnose a fever by checking the persons body temperature, but they will also need to diagnose the reason for the fever.To do so, they will examine the individual and ask them about any other symptoms and their medical history. If the person has recently experienced another infection, if they have recently had surgery, or if there is pain or swelling in one area, it may indicate what kind of infection is likely to be present.To confirm a diagnosis, the doctor may recommend: a blood testa urine testimaging testsThe treatment they prescribe will depend on the cause of the fever.PreventionTo prevent a fever, people should follow the usual steps for reducing the risk of an infection.These include regular hand-washing and staying away from people who are unwell.Preventing COVID-19To reduce the risk of transmitting or contracting COVID-19, the CDC recommend: washing the hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds each timeusing hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not availablenot touching the face with unwashed handscovering the face with a mask or cloth covering when near other people, except for children under 2 yearscleaning and disinfecting surfaces regularlycoughing and sneezing into a tissue, then disposing of the tissue and washing the handsavoiding close contact with people who are unwellFor information on how to make and wear a face mask, see the CDCs advice here.SummaryA fever is usually a symptom of an infection. It is not usually a cause for concern, but the underlying illness may need medical treatment. Often, a fever will resolve without medical attention. However, if a child or an older adult has a fever, if the individual has other severe or worsening symptoms, or if they have a weakened immune system, they should seek medical help.If a person has a dry cough with a fever, they may have COVID-19. If they start to experience difficulty breathing, someone should call 911 and ask for emergency help.

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm  or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs)  also known as your body's "thermostat"  monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children.

Most providers say a fever is either 100.0 F (37.8 C) or 100.4 F (38 C). When you have a fever, its your bodys normal response to fighting an infection or illness. Fevers usually arent a serious concern. They typically go away when the infection passes.ContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat is a fever?A fever is when your body temperature rises higher than normal. A fever itself isnt an illness. Rather, its a symptom of a wide range of health conditions. When your body temperature rises a few degrees above normal, it can be a sign that your immune system has been activated, often to fight an infection. It can also be a side effect of some medications and vaccinations.What is considered a fever?Common knowledge states that a normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). But your baseline body temperature may vary by a degree or more. It also fluctuates. Its typically lower in the morning and higher in the evening. Its higher during certain points of your menstrual cycle and when youre exercising.Infants and young children normally have slightly higher body temperatures than older children and adults. So infants and younger children have slightly higher fever temperatures.There are no strict guidelines for what temperature is a fever, because body temperature varies by person, time of day and method of measurement. But healthcare providers most often say a fever temperature is 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) when measured orally (by mouth).Rectal and ear thermometers typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) higher than oral thermometers. Skin thermometers (such as forehead thermometers) typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) lower than oral thermometers.What is a low-grade fever?A low-grade fever means a body temperature slightly above normal. This type of fever can be a sign your immune system has been mildly activated. Theres no standard low-grade fever range. But many healthcare providers consider a body temperature between 99.5 degrees F (37.5 degrees C) and 100.3 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) to be a low-grade fever.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat are fever symptoms?In addition to an elevated temperature, you may experience the following symptoms:Chills, feeling cold, shivering and shaking.Body aches and headaches.Fatigue (tiredness).On and off or constant sweating.Flushed complexion or hot skin.Faster heart beats.Additional fever symptoms in babies and children may include:Lack of appetite  not eating and drinking well.Earache or pulling at their ears.High-pitched crying.Fussiness.Paleness or flushness.Excessive thirst.Decreased urination.Possible CausesWhat are the most common causes of fever?A fever has many causes and can be a symptom of almost any illness. Common conditions that cause fever include:Bacterial infections.Viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19.Gastrointestinal (GI) infections.Urinary tract infections.Skin infections.You may also develop a fever due to:A reaction to certain medications.Vaccinations.Autoimmune disorders.Cancer.Can allergies cause fever?Allergies can cause cold-like symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes, but they typically dont cause fever. Despite its name, hay fever (also called allergic rhinitis) doesnt cause fever.AdvertisementCare and TreatmentWhats the best way to measure body temperature?You can take your temperature in several different parts of your body. The most common site is your mouth (oral temperature). Other sites include your ear (tympanic membrane), forehead (temporal artery) and armpit (axillary). The most accurate site is the rectum, and the least accurate site is the armpit.The best way to measure your temperature is with a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers contain mercury and providers no longer recommend them.How can I break a fever at home?If your fever is mild  less than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C)  you usually dont need treatment with medication. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. Taking a lukewarm bath  about 98 degrees F (36.7 degrees C)  may also help bring your bodys temperature down. Keep an eye on signs of dehydration and other worsening symptoms.If youre feeling uncomfortable and your temperature is higher than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C), you can try to break the fever. The most common way to get rid of a fever is to use over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.Dont give aspirin to children under the age of 17. Aspirin in children may cause Reyes syndrome, a sometimes fatal illness.Does ibuprofen reduce fever?Yes, you can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen to try to reduce a fever.How long does a fever last?The cause of the fever determines how long itll last. Typically, if an infection is the cause of your fever, it should pass within three to four days. Call your healthcare provider if the fever lingers longer than that or comes along with breathing changes.AdvertisementCan fevers be prevented?You can prevent some fevers by avoiding the illnesses and infections that cause them. Sometimes, children develop fevers after receiving vaccinations. You can prevent these types of fevers by giving your child acetaminophen just before or after the vaccination. But you cant prevent most fevers. Theyre typically a sign that your body is doing what its supposed to do.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentWhen To Call the DoctorWhen should a fever be treated by a healthcare provider?In adults, fevers less than 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) typically arent dangerous and arent a cause for concern. If your fever rises above that level, make a call to your healthcare provider for treatment.In children, call your childs healthcare provider if:Their fever lasts more than five days.Their fever is higher than 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen dont break the fever.Youre concerned they arent behaving normally.They have any problems breathing or urinating.When should I go to the ER?If you have a fever along with any of the following symptoms, go to your nearest emergency room or call 911. It may be a sign of a serious or life-threatening illness.Pain or tenderness in your belly (abdomen).Nausea or vomiting.Severe headache.Stiff neck.Light irritates your eyes (photophobia).Convulsions or seizures.Difficulty breathing.Strange behavior and/or altered speech.Confusion or irritability.Difficulty waking or extreme sleepiness.Fever rash (small bleeding spots under your skin).When should I take my child to the ER?If your baby has a fever and is under 3 months of age, take them to the ER right away. Your babys immune system hasnt developed fully yet, and they could have a serious infection.If your child has a fever along with any of the following symptoms, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room:Extreme sluggishness or drowsiness.Lack of appetite.Excessive drooling or difficulty swallowing.Continuous crying.Stiff neck.Fever rash.Difficulty breathing.Severe abdominal pain.Redness or swelling.Dehydration (not drinking many fluids).Decreased urination.What are the possible complications or risks of not treating a fever?Untreated fevers above 105.8 degrees F (41 degrees C) can be dangerous. If your body temperature reaches this level, your organs will begin to malfunction and will eventually fail.Even moderate fevers can be dangerous for adults with lung or heart disorders because fever causes your breathing rate and heart rate to increase. Fever can also worsen the mental state of people with dementia.Additional Common QuestionsWhat is a recurrent fever?A recurrent fever is a fever that keeps coming back multiple times over a period of time. Providers call these fevers episodic because they come and go. The fever lasts for a few days and then goes away for a stretch of time. Your child is healthy and acts normally between fevers. Recurrent fevers affect young children under the age of 5 most often. Theyre one of the main symptoms of a collection of conditions called periodic fever syndromes.What is a febrile seizure?Some children have a side effect of fevers called febrile seizures. This happens in 2% to 4% of children under the age of 5. Some seizures cause jerking movements, or it may look like your child has passed out. When this happens, put your child on their side and dont put anything in their mouth. Call 911 if the seizure lasts for more than five minutes and/or your childs lips turn blue.If the seizure lasts less than five minutes, notify their healthcare provider and get medical attention right away.What is a fever dream?Fever dreams are vivid, bizarre or unpleasant dreams you may experience when your body temperature rises higher than normal. Researchers dont know the exact cause of fever dreams. But some scientists think fevers cause your brain to overheat, affecting your cognitive processing, which results in dreams stranger than your typical dreams. Fevers may also interrupt your REM sleep cycle, which can lead to unusual dreams.A note from Cleveland ClinicWhile a fever can be uncomfortable, its typically a sign that your body is working properly and your immune system is kicking into action. You dont need to treat low fevers, but you can take over-the-counter pain relievers until they pass. If you or your child has a higher temperature or your fever hasnt passed within a few days, you should make a call to your healthcare provider. While infections most often cause fevers, there could be other underlying conditions youll want to get checked out.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 05/31/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

It is a common sign of an infection.As a persons body temperature increases, they may feel cold until it levels off and stops rising. People describe this as chills.Eating, exercise, sleeping, the time of day, and individual factors can also affect temperature. When an infection occurs, the immune system will launch an attack to try to remove the cause. A high body temperature is a normal part of this reaction. A fever will usually resolve on its own. However, if body temperature rises too high, it may be a symptom of a severe infection that needs medical treatment. In this case, a doctor may recommend medication to reduce it.Read on to learn more about the symptoms of a fever, as well as some causes and treatment options.SymptomsShare on PinterestA fever is a common sign of an infection.When someone has a fever, they may also:shiver and feel cold when nobody else doessweathave a low appetiteshow signs of dehydrationhave increased sensitivity to painlack energy and feel sleepyhave difficulty concentratingIf a baby has a fever, they may:feel hot to the touchhave flushed cheeksbe sweaty or clammyWith a high fever, there may also be irritability, confusion, delirium, and seizures.COVID-19 symptomsIf a person has a fever with a dry cough, they may have symptoms of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urge people with these symptoms to stay at home and away from other people. The person should also wear a face covering if other people are near.In many cases, the symptoms will improve without specialist treatment. However, if the person also develops severe chest pain or difficulty breathing, they should call 911 and ask for medical help. Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, most people now use a digital thermometer. Experts do not recommend using a glass thermometer, as these can be dangerous. Some people use a forehead strip, but these may be less accurate.A person can put a thermometer under their arm or in their mouth.To use a digital device: Clean the tip using cold water and soap, and then rinse it.Turn on the device.Place the tip under the tongue, toward the back of the mouth, and close the mouth. Or, place it under the armpit and hold the device close to the body.Wait until there is a flash or the thermometer beeps.Read the temperature.Normal armpit temperature will be around 0.5 to 0.9ºF (0.3 to 0.5°C) lower than oral temperature.If the reading is 100.4°F (38°C) or above, the person has a fever. Thermometers are available for purchase over the counter or online.Is it possible to take someones temperature without a thermometer? Find out here.When should I worry?Doctors classify fevers according to how long they last, whether or not they come and go, and how high they are.SeverityCore body temperature varies from person to person.Most experts consider a temperature of 100.4° F (38°C) to be a fever, but in children, this may be lower, at 99.5°F (37.5°C).Hyperpyrexia can occur when a persons temperature rises above 106°F (41.1°C). Without treatment, this can lead to complications.Learn more about normal body temperature and when a person should worry here.DurationA fever can be:acute if it lasts for under 7 dayssubacute if it lasts for up to 14 dayschronic or persistent if it lasts for over 14 daysFevers that exist for days or weeks with no explanation are called fevers of unknown origin.TreatmentA mild fever is part of the immune systems response to bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. It helps the body fight off infection.However, it can be uncomfortable, and a high fever can sometimes lead to complications. For this reason, doctors may sometimes recommend medications called antipyretics to lower a persons temperature.Examples include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can also reduce a fever. Aspirin can help, but it is not suitable for children, and it may not be suitable for people who take blood thinners. NSAIDs and Tylenol are available to purchase over the counter or online.If a person is sweating a lot, they may experience dehydration. In this case, they should consume plenty of fluids to prevent complications.Treating the causeA fever is a symptom, not an illness. A doctor may wish to carry out tests to identify the cause. If the fever is due to a bacterial infection, they may prescribe an antibiotic.If it stems from a viral infection, the doctor may recommend using NSAIDs to relieve the symptoms. Antibiotics will not stop a virus. A doctor will not prescribe them for a viral infection.NSAIDs will not help if the fever is due to hot weather or sustained strenuous exercise. In these cases, it is essential to cool the person down. If they are confused or unconscious, they need immediate medical care.COVID-19A person with symptoms of COVID-19 may not need any medical treatment. However, if they develop severe chest pains and have difficulty breathing, they may need hospital treatment. Some people will need to spend time on a ventilator, which is a device that will help them breathe.CausesFevers can result from various factors, including:an infection, such as strep throat, the flu, chickenpox, pneumonia, or COVID-19rheumatoid arthritissome medicationsoverexposing the skin to sunlight, or sunburnheatstroke, either due to high ambient temperatures or prolonged strenuous exercisedehydrationsilicosis, which is a type of lung disease caused by long-term exposure to silica dustamphetamine abusealcohol withdrawalIn childrenChildren with a high temperature may develop a febrile seizure. These are most likely to occur between the ages of 12 and 18 months.These often result from an ear infection, gastroenteritis, or a respiratory virus, and they are not usually serious. Less commonly, they may stem from a more severe illness, such as meningitis, a kidney infection, or pneumonia.Seizures can occur when the body temperature rises quickly.There are two types of febrile seizure: simple febrile seizures and complex febrile seizures.Simple febrile seizuresThis type of febrile seizure can last from a few seconds up to 15 minutes. However, it usually lasts less than 5 minutes. It does not occur again during a 24-hour period. Around 8085% of febrile seizures are of this type.It typically involves the whole body, and symptoms include:stiffness in the bodytwitching in the arms and legsa loss of consciousness while the eyes stay openThere may also be: irregular breathingurination, defecation, or bothvomitingComplex febrile seizuresThis type of febrile seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes, comes back more often, and tends to affect only a part of the body, rather than the whole body.Complex febrile seizures are more serious than simple febrile seizures. A child who has a complex febrile seizure is more likely to experience epilepsy as they grow older.In fact, around 3040% of children who have either type of seizure will have other similar seizures at a later date.When to see a doctorIn most cases, a child who has a seizure should see a doctor. The doctor may suggest controlling their temperature with acetaminophen and ensuring that they drink plenty of fluids. If necessary, they may also prescribe an anticonvulsant, such as sodium valproate or clonazepam.DiagnosisA fever is a symptom, not an illness. A doctor can diagnose a fever by checking the persons body temperature, but they will also need to diagnose the reason for the fever.To do so, they will examine the individual and ask them about any other symptoms and their medical history. If the person has recently experienced another infection, if they have recently had surgery, or if there is pain or swelling in one area, it may indicate what kind of infection is likely to be present.To confirm a diagnosis, the doctor may recommend: a blood testa urine testimaging testsThe treatment they prescribe will depend on the cause of the fever.PreventionTo prevent a fever, people should follow the usual steps for reducing the risk of an infection.These include regular hand-washing and staying away from people who are unwell.Preventing COVID-19To reduce the risk of transmitting or contracting COVID-19, the CDC recommend: washing the hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds each timeusing hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not availablenot touching the face with unwashed handscovering the face with a mask or cloth covering when near other people, except for children under 2 yearscleaning and disinfecting surfaces regularlycoughing and sneezing into a tissue, then disposing of the tissue and washing the handsavoiding close contact with people who are unwellFor information on how to make and wear a face mask, see the CDCs advice here.SummaryA fever is usually a symptom of an infection. It is not usually a cause for concern, but the underlying illness may need medical treatment. Often, a fever will resolve without medical attention. However, if a child or an older adult has a fever, if the individual has other severe or worsening symptoms, or if they have a weakened immune system, they should seek medical help.If a person has a dry cough with a fever, they may have COVID-19. If they start to experience difficulty breathing, someone should call 911 and ask for emergency help.

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm  or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs)  also known as your body's "thermostat"  monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.

Most providers say a fever is either 100.0 F (37.8 C) or 100.4 F (38 C). When you have a fever, its your bodys normal response to fighting an infection or illness. Fevers usually arent a serious concern. They typically go away when the infection passes.ContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat is a fever?A fever is when your body temperature rises higher than normal. A fever itself isnt an illness. Rather, its a symptom of a wide range of health conditions. When your body temperature rises a few degrees above normal, it can be a sign that your immune system has been activated, often to fight an infection. It can also be a side effect of some medications and vaccinations.What is considered a fever?Common knowledge states that a normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). But your baseline body temperature may vary by a degree or more. It also fluctuates. Its typically lower in the morning and higher in the evening. Its higher during certain points of your menstrual cycle and when youre exercising.Infants and young children normally have slightly higher body temperatures than older children and adults. So infants and younger children have slightly higher fever temperatures.There are no strict guidelines for what temperature is a fever, because body temperature varies by person, time of day and method of measurement. But healthcare providers most often say a fever temperature is 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) when measured orally (by mouth).Rectal and ear thermometers typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) higher than oral thermometers. Skin thermometers (such as forehead thermometers) typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) lower than oral thermometers.What is a low-grade fever?A low-grade fever means a body temperature slightly above normal. This type of fever can be a sign your immune system has been mildly activated. Theres no standard low-grade fever range. But many healthcare providers consider a body temperature between 99.5 degrees F (37.5 degrees C) and 100.3 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) to be a low-grade fever.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat are fever symptoms?In addition to an elevated temperature, you may experience the following symptoms:Chills, feeling cold, shivering and shaking.Body aches and headaches.Fatigue (tiredness).On and off or constant sweating.Flushed complexion or hot skin.Faster heart beats.Additional fever symptoms in babies and children may include:Lack of appetite  not eating and drinking well.Earache or pulling at their ears.High-pitched crying.Fussiness.Paleness or flushness.Excessive thirst.Decreased urination.Possible CausesWhat are the most common causes of fever?A fever has many causes and can be a symptom of almost any illness. Common conditions that cause fever include:Bacterial infections.Viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19.Gastrointestinal (GI) infections.Urinary tract infections.Skin infections.You may also develop a fever due to:A reaction to certain medications.Vaccinations.Autoimmune disorders.Cancer.Can allergies cause fever?Allergies can cause cold-like symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes, but they typically dont cause fever. Despite its name, hay fever (also called allergic rhinitis) doesnt cause fever.AdvertisementCare and TreatmentWhats the best way to measure body temperature?You can take your temperature in several different parts of your body. The most common site is your mouth (oral temperature). Other sites include your ear (tympanic membrane), forehead (temporal artery) and armpit (axillary). The most accurate site is the rectum, and the least accurate site is the armpit.The best way to measure your temperature is with a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers contain mercury and providers no longer recommend them.How can I break a fever at home?If your fever is mild  less than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C)  you usually dont need treatment with medication. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. Taking a lukewarm bath  about 98 degrees F (36.7 degrees C)  may also help bring your bodys temperature down. Keep an eye on signs of dehydration and other worsening symptoms.If youre feeling uncomfortable and your temperature is higher than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C), you can try to break the fever. The most common way to get rid of a fever is to use over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.Dont give aspirin to children under the age of 17. Aspirin in children may cause Reyes syndrome, a sometimes fatal illness.Does ibuprofen reduce fever?Yes, you can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen to try to reduce a fever.How long does a fever last?The cause of the fever determines how long itll last. Typically, if an infection is the cause of your fever, it should pass within three to four days. Call your healthcare provider if the fever lingers longer than that or comes along with breathing changes.AdvertisementCan fevers be prevented?You can prevent some fevers by avoiding the illnesses and infections that cause them. Sometimes, children develop fevers after receiving vaccinations. You can prevent these types of fevers by giving your child acetaminophen just before or after the vaccination. But you cant prevent most fevers. Theyre typically a sign that your body is doing what its supposed to do.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentWhen To Call the DoctorWhen should a fever be treated by a healthcare provider?In adults, fevers less than 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) typically arent dangerous and arent a cause for concern. If your fever rises above that level, make a call to your healthcare provider for treatment.In children, call your childs healthcare provider if:Their fever lasts more than five days.Their fever is higher than 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen dont break the fever.Youre concerned they arent behaving normally.They have any problems breathing or urinating.When should I go to the ER?If you have a fever along with any of the following symptoms, go to your nearest emergency room or call 911. It may be a sign of a serious or life-threatening illness.Pain or tenderness in your belly (abdomen).Nausea or vomiting.Severe headache.Stiff neck.Light irritates your eyes (photophobia).Convulsions or seizures.Difficulty breathing.Strange behavior and/or altered speech.Confusion or irritability.Difficulty waking or extreme sleepiness.Fever rash (small bleeding spots under your skin).When should I take my child to the ER?If your baby has a fever and is under 3 months of age, take them to the ER right away. Your babys immune system hasnt developed fully yet, and they could have a serious infection.If your child has a fever along with any of the following symptoms, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room:Extreme sluggishness or drowsiness.Lack of appetite.Excessive drooling or difficulty swallowing.Continuous crying.Stiff neck.Fever rash.Difficulty breathing.Severe abdominal pain.Redness or swelling.Dehydration (not drinking many fluids).Decreased urination.What are the possible complications or risks of not treating a fever?Untreated fevers above 105.8 degrees F (41 degrees C) can be dangerous. If your body temperature reaches this level, your organs will begin to malfunction and will eventually fail.Even moderate fevers can be dangerous for adults with lung or heart disorders because fever causes your breathing rate and heart rate to increase. Fever can also worsen the mental state of people with dementia.Additional Common QuestionsWhat is a recurrent fever?A recurrent fever is a fever that keeps coming back multiple times over a period of time. Providers call these fevers episodic because they come and go. The fever lasts for a few days and then goes away for a stretch of time. Your child is healthy and acts normally between fevers. Recurrent fevers affect young children under the age of 5 most often. Theyre one of the main symptoms of a collection of conditions called periodic fever syndromes.What is a febrile seizure?Some children have a side effect of fevers called febrile seizures. This happens in 2% to 4% of children under the age of 5. Some seizures cause jerking movements, or it may look like your child has passed out. When this happens, put your child on their side and dont put anything in their mouth. Call 911 if the seizure lasts for more than five minutes and/or your childs lips turn blue.If the seizure lasts less than five minutes, notify their healthcare provider and get medical attention right away.What is a fever dream?Fever dreams are vivid, bizarre or unpleasant dreams you may experience when your body temperature rises higher than normal. Researchers dont know the exact cause of fever dreams. But some scientists think fevers cause your brain to overheat, affecting your cognitive processing, which results in dreams stranger than your typical dreams. Fevers may also interrupt your REM sleep cycle, which can lead to unusual dreams.A note from Cleveland ClinicWhile a fever can be uncomfortable, its typically a sign that your body is working properly and your immune system is kicking into action. You dont need to treat low fevers, but you can take over-the-counter pain relievers until they pass. If you or your child has a higher temperature or your fever hasnt passed within a few days, you should make a call to your healthcare provider. While infections most often cause fevers, there could be other underlying conditions youll want to get checked out.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 05/31/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

It is a common sign of an infection.As a persons body temperature increases, they may feel cold until it levels off and stops rising. People describe this as chills.Eating, exercise, sleeping, the time of day, and individual factors can also affect temperature. When an infection occurs, the immune system will launch an attack to try to remove the cause. A high body temperature is a normal part of this reaction. A fever will usually resolve on its own. However, if body temperature rises too high, it may be a symptom of a severe infection that needs medical treatment. In this case, a doctor may recommend medication to reduce it.Read on to learn more about the symptoms of a fever, as well as some causes and treatment options.SymptomsShare on PinterestA fever is a common sign of an infection.When someone has a fever, they may also:shiver and feel cold when nobody else doessweathave a low appetiteshow signs of dehydrationhave increased sensitivity to painlack energy and feel sleepyhave difficulty concentratingIf a baby has a fever, they may:feel hot to the touchhave flushed cheeksbe sweaty or clammyWith a high fever, there may also be irritability, confusion, delirium, and seizures.COVID-19 symptomsIf a person has a fever with a dry cough, they may have symptoms of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urge people with these symptoms to stay at home and away from other people. The person should also wear a face covering if other people are near.In many cases, the symptoms will improve without specialist treatment. However, if the person also develops severe chest pain or difficulty breathing, they should call 911 and ask for medical help. Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, most people now use a digital thermometer. Experts do not recommend using a glass thermometer, as these can be dangerous. Some people use a forehead strip, but these may be less accurate.A person can put a thermometer under their arm or in their mouth.To use a digital device: Clean the tip using cold water and soap, and then rinse it.Turn on the device.Place the tip under the tongue, toward the back of the mouth, and close the mouth. Or, place it under the armpit and hold the device close to the body.Wait until there is a flash or the thermometer beeps.Read the temperature.Normal armpit temperature will be around 0.5 to 0.9ºF (0.3 to 0.5°C) lower than oral temperature.If the reading is 100.4°F (38°C) or above, the person has a fever. Thermometers are available for purchase over the counter or online.Is it possible to take someones temperature without a thermometer? Find out here.When should I worry?Doctors classify fevers according to how long they last, whether or not they come and go, and how high they are.SeverityCore body temperature varies from person to person.Most experts consider a temperature of 100.4° F (38°C) to be a fever, but in children, this may be lower, at 99.5°F (37.5°C).Hyperpyrexia can occur when a persons temperature rises above 106°F (41.1°C). Without treatment, this can lead to complications.Learn more about normal body temperature and when a person should worry here.DurationA fever can be:acute if it lasts for under 7 dayssubacute if it lasts for up to 14 dayschronic or persistent if it lasts for over 14 daysFevers that exist for days or weeks with no explanation are called fevers of unknown origin.TreatmentA mild fever is part of the immune systems response to bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. It helps the body fight off infection.However, it can be uncomfortable, and a high fever can sometimes lead to complications. For this reason, doctors may sometimes recommend medications called antipyretics to lower a persons temperature.Examples include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can also reduce a fever. Aspirin can help, but it is not suitable for children, and it may not be suitable for people who take blood thinners. NSAIDs and Tylenol are available to purchase over the counter or online.If a person is sweating a lot, they may experience dehydration. In this case, they should consume plenty of fluids to prevent complications.Treating the causeA fever is a symptom, not an illness. A doctor may wish to carry out tests to identify the cause. If the fever is due to a bacterial infection, they may prescribe an antibiotic.If it stems from a viral infection, the doctor may recommend using NSAIDs to relieve the symptoms. Antibiotics will not stop a virus. A doctor will not prescribe them for a viral infection.NSAIDs will not help if the fever is due to hot weather or sustained strenuous exercise. In these cases, it is essential to cool the person down. If they are confused or unconscious, they need immediate medical care.COVID-19A person with symptoms of COVID-19 may not need any medical treatment. However, if they develop severe chest pains and have difficulty breathing, they may need hospital treatment. Some people will need to spend time on a ventilator, which is a device that will help them breathe.CausesFevers can result from various factors, including:an infection, such as strep throat, the flu, chickenpox, pneumonia, or COVID-19rheumatoid arthritissome medicationsoverexposing the skin to sunlight, or sunburnheatstroke, either due to high ambient temperatures or prolonged strenuous exercisedehydrationsilicosis, which is a type of lung disease caused by long-term exposure to silica dustamphetamine abusealcohol withdrawalIn childrenChildren with a high temperature may develop a febrile seizure. These are most likely to occur between the ages of 12 and 18 months.These often result from an ear infection, gastroenteritis, or a respiratory virus, and they are not usually serious. Less commonly, they may stem from a more severe illness, such as meningitis, a kidney infection, or pneumonia.Seizures can occur when the body temperature rises quickly.There are two types of febrile seizure: simple febrile seizures and complex febrile seizures.Simple febrile seizuresThis type of febrile seizure can last from a few seconds up to 15 minutes. However, it usually lasts less than 5 minutes. It does not occur again during a 24-hour period. Around 8085% of febrile seizures are of this type.It typically involves the whole body, and symptoms include:stiffness in the bodytwitching in the arms and legsa loss of consciousness while the eyes stay openThere may also be: irregular breathingurination, defecation, or bothvomitingComplex febrile seizuresThis type of febrile seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes, comes back more often, and tends to affect only a part of the body, rather than the whole body.Complex febrile seizures are more serious than simple febrile seizures. A child who has a complex febrile seizure is more likely to experience epilepsy as they grow older.In fact, around 3040% of children who have either type of seizure will have other similar seizures at a later date.When to see a doctorIn most cases, a child who has a seizure should see a doctor. The doctor may suggest controlling their temperature with acetaminophen and ensuring that they drink plenty of fluids. If necessary, they may also prescribe an anticonvulsant, such as sodium valproate or clonazepam.DiagnosisA fever is a symptom, not an illness. A doctor can diagnose a fever by checking the persons body temperature, but they will also need to diagnose the reason for the fever.To do so, they will examine the individual and ask them about any other symptoms and their medical history. If the person has recently experienced another infection, if they have recently had surgery, or if there is pain or swelling in one area, it may indicate what kind of infection is likely to be present.To confirm a diagnosis, the doctor may recommend: a blood testa urine testimaging testsThe treatment they prescribe will depend on the cause of the fever.PreventionTo prevent a fever, people should follow the usual steps for reducing the risk of an infection.These include regular hand-washing and staying away from people who are unwell.Preventing COVID-19To reduce the risk of transmitting or contracting COVID-19, the CDC recommend: washing the hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds each timeusing hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not availablenot touching the face with unwashed handscovering the face with a mask or cloth covering when near other people, except for children under 2 yearscleaning and disinfecting surfaces regularlycoughing and sneezing into a tissue, then disposing of the tissue and washing the handsavoiding close contact with people who are unwellFor information on how to make and wear a face mask, see the CDCs advice here.SummaryA fever is usually a symptom of an infection. It is not usually a cause for concern, but the underlying illness may need medical treatment. Often, a fever will resolve without medical attention. However, if a child or an older adult has a fever, if the individual has other severe or worsening symptoms, or if they have a weakened immune system, they should seek medical help.If a person has a dry cough with a fever, they may have COVID-19. If they start to experience difficulty breathing, someone should call 911 and ask for emergency help.

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm  or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs)  also known as your body's "thermostat"  monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children.

Most providers say a fever is either 100.0 F (37.8 C) or 100.4 F (38 C). When you have a fever, its your bodys normal response to fighting an infection or illness. Fevers usually arent a serious concern. They typically go away when the infection passes.ContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat is a fever?A fever is when your body temperature rises higher than normal. A fever itself isnt an illness. Rather, its a symptom of a wide range of health conditions. When your body temperature rises a few degrees above normal, it can be a sign that your immune system has been activated, often to fight an infection. It can also be a side effect of some medications and vaccinations.What is considered a fever?Common knowledge states that a normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). But your baseline body temperature may vary by a degree or more. It also fluctuates. Its typically lower in the morning and higher in the evening. Its higher during certain points of your menstrual cycle and when youre exercising.Infants and young children normally have slightly higher body temperatures than older children and adults. So infants and younger children have slightly higher fever temperatures.There are no strict guidelines for what temperature is a fever, because body temperature varies by person, time of day and method of measurement. But healthcare providers most often say a fever temperature is 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) when measured orally (by mouth).Rectal and ear thermometers typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) higher than oral thermometers. Skin thermometers (such as forehead thermometers) typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) lower than oral thermometers.What is a low-grade fever?A low-grade fever means a body temperature slightly above normal. This type of fever can be a sign your immune system has been mildly activated. Theres no standard low-grade fever range. But many healthcare providers consider a body temperature between 99.5 degrees F (37.5 degrees C) and 100.3 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) to be a low-grade fever.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat are fever symptoms?In addition to an elevated temperature, you may experience the following symptoms:Chills, feeling cold, shivering and shaking.Body aches and headaches.Fatigue (tiredness).On and off or constant sweating.Flushed complexion or hot skin.Faster heart beats.Additional fever symptoms in babies and children may include:Lack of appetite  not eating and drinking well.Earache or pulling at their ears.High-pitched crying.Fussiness.Paleness or flushness.Excessive thirst.Decreased urination.Possible CausesWhat are the most common causes of fever?A fever has many causes and can be a symptom of almost any illness. Common conditions that cause fever include:Bacterial infections.Viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19.Gastrointestinal (GI) infections.Urinary tract infections.Skin infections.You may also develop a fever due to:A reaction to certain medications.Vaccinations.Autoimmune disorders.Cancer.Can allergies cause fever?Allergies can cause cold-like symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes, but they typically dont cause fever. Despite its name, hay fever (also called allergic rhinitis) doesnt cause fever.AdvertisementCare and TreatmentWhats the best way to measure body temperature?You can take your temperature in several different parts of your body. The most common site is your mouth (oral temperature). Other sites include your ear (tympanic membrane), forehead (temporal artery) and armpit (axillary). The most accurate site is the rectum, and the least accurate site is the armpit.The best way to measure your temperature is with a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers contain mercury and providers no longer recommend them.How can I break a fever at home?If your fever is mild  less than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C)  you usually dont need treatment with medication. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. Taking a lukewarm bath  about 98 degrees F (36.7 degrees C)  may also help bring your bodys temperature down. Keep an eye on signs of dehydration and other worsening symptoms.If youre feeling uncomfortable and your temperature is higher than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C), you can try to break the fever. The most common way to get rid of a fever is to use over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.Dont give aspirin to children under the age of 17. Aspirin in children may cause Reyes syndrome, a sometimes fatal illness.Does ibuprofen reduce fever?Yes, you can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen to try to reduce a fever.How long does a fever last?The cause of the fever determines how long itll last. Typically, if an infection is the cause of your fever, it should pass within three to four days. Call your healthcare provider if the fever lingers longer than that or comes along with breathing changes.AdvertisementCan fevers be prevented?You can prevent some fevers by avoiding the illnesses and infections that cause them. Sometimes, children develop fevers after receiving vaccinations. You can prevent these types of fevers by giving your child acetaminophen just before or after the vaccination. But you cant prevent most fevers. Theyre typically a sign that your body is doing what its supposed to do.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentWhen To Call the DoctorWhen should a fever be treated by a healthcare provider?In adults, fevers less than 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) typically arent dangerous and arent a cause for concern. If your fever rises above that level, make a call to your healthcare provider for treatment.In children, call your childs healthcare provider if:Their fever lasts more than five days.Their fever is higher than 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen dont break the fever.Youre concerned they arent behaving normally.They have any problems breathing or urinating.When should I go to the ER?If you have a fever along with any of the following symptoms, go to your nearest emergency room or call 911. It may be a sign of a serious or life-threatening illness.Pain or tenderness in your belly (abdomen).Nausea or vomiting.Severe headache.Stiff neck.Light irritates your eyes (photophobia).Convulsions or seizures.Difficulty breathing.Strange behavior and/or altered speech.Confusion or irritability.Difficulty waking or extreme sleepiness.Fever rash (small bleeding spots under your skin).When should I take my child to the ER?If your baby has a fever and is under 3 months of age, take them to the ER right away. Your babys immune system hasnt developed fully yet, and they could have a serious infection.If your child has a fever along with any of the following symptoms, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room:Extreme sluggishness or drowsiness.Lack of appetite.Excessive drooling or difficulty swallowing.Continuous crying.Stiff neck.Fever rash.Difficulty breathing.Severe abdominal pain.Redness or swelling.Dehydration (not drinking many fluids).Decreased urination.What are the possible complications or risks of not treating a fever?Untreated fevers above 105.8 degrees F (41 degrees C) can be dangerous. If your body temperature reaches this level, your organs will begin to malfunction and will eventually fail.Even moderate fevers can be dangerous for adults with lung or heart disorders because fever causes your breathing rate and heart rate to increase. Fever can also worsen the mental state of people with dementia.Additional Common QuestionsWhat is a recurrent fever?A recurrent fever is a fever that keeps coming back multiple times over a period of time. Providers call these fevers episodic because they come and go. The fever lasts for a few days and then goes away for a stretch of time. Your child is healthy and acts normally between fevers. Recurrent fevers affect young children under the age of 5 most often. Theyre one of the main symptoms of a collection of conditions called periodic fever syndromes.What is a febrile seizure?Some children have a side effect of fevers called febrile seizures. This happens in 2% to 4% of children under the age of 5. Some seizures cause jerking movements, or it may look like your child has passed out. When this happens, put your child on their side and dont put anything in their mouth. Call 911 if the seizure lasts for more than five minutes and/or your childs lips turn blue.If the seizure lasts less than five minutes, notify their healthcare provider and get medical attention right away.What is a fever dream?Fever dreams are vivid, bizarre or unpleasant dreams you may experience when your body temperature rises higher than normal. Researchers dont know the exact cause of fever dreams. But some scientists think fevers cause your brain to overheat, affecting your cognitive processing, which results in dreams stranger than your typical dreams. Fevers may also interrupt your REM sleep cycle, which can lead to unusual dreams.A note from Cleveland ClinicWhile a fever can be uncomfortable, its typically a sign that your body is working properly and your immune system is kicking into action. You dont need to treat low fevers, but you can take over-the-counter pain relievers until they pass. If you or your child has a higher temperature or your fever hasnt passed within a few days, you should make a call to your healthcare provider. While infections most often cause fevers, there could be other underlying conditions youll want to get checked out.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 05/31/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

It is a common sign of an infection.As a persons body temperature increases, they may feel cold until it levels off and stops rising. People describe this as chills.Eating, exercise, sleeping, the time of day, and individual factors can also affect temperature. When an infection occurs, the immune system will launch an attack to try to remove the cause. A high body temperature is a normal part of this reaction. A fever will usually resolve on its own. However, if body temperature rises too high, it may be a symptom of a severe infection that needs medical treatment. In this case, a doctor may recommend medication to reduce it.Read on to learn more about the symptoms of a fever, as well as some causes and treatment options.SymptomsShare on PinterestA fever is a common sign of an infection.When someone has a fever, they may also:shiver and feel cold when nobody else doessweathave a low appetiteshow signs of dehydrationhave increased sensitivity to painlack energy and feel sleepyhave difficulty concentratingIf a baby has a fever, they may:feel hot to the touchhave flushed cheeksbe sweaty or clammyWith a high fever, there may also be irritability, confusion, delirium, and seizures.COVID-19 symptomsIf a person has a fever with a dry cough, they may have symptoms of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urge people with these symptoms to stay at home and away from other people. The person should also wear a face covering if other people are near.In many cases, the symptoms will improve without specialist treatment. However, if the person also develops severe chest pain or difficulty breathing, they should call 911 and ask for medical help. Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, most people now use a digital thermometer. Experts do not recommend using a glass thermometer, as these can be dangerous. Some people use a forehead strip, but these may be less accurate.A person can put a thermometer under their arm or in their mouth.To use a digital device: Clean the tip using cold water and soap, and then rinse it.Turn on the device.Place the tip under the tongue, toward the back of the mouth, and close the mouth. Or, place it under the armpit and hold the device close to the body.Wait until there is a flash or the thermometer beeps.Read the temperature.Normal armpit temperature will be around 0.5 to 0.9ºF (0.3 to 0.5°C) lower than oral temperature.If the reading is 100.4°F (38°C) or above, the person has a fever. Thermometers are available for purchase over the counter or online.Is it possible to take someones temperature without a thermometer? Find out here.When should I worry?Doctors classify fevers according to how long they last, whether or not they come and go, and how high they are.SeverityCore body temperature varies from person to person.Most experts consider a temperature of 100.4° F (38°C) to be a fever, but in children, this may be lower, at 99.5°F (37.5°C).Hyperpyrexia can occur when a persons temperature rises above 106°F (41.1°C). Without treatment, this can lead to complications.Learn more about normal body temperature and when a person should worry here.DurationA fever can be:acute if it lasts for under 7 dayssubacute if it lasts for up to 14 dayschronic or persistent if it lasts for over 14 daysFevers that exist for days or weeks with no explanation are called fevers of unknown origin.TreatmentA mild fever is part of the immune systems response to bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. It helps the body fight off infection.However, it can be uncomfortable, and a high fever can sometimes lead to complications. For this reason, doctors may sometimes recommend medications called antipyretics to lower a persons temperature.Examples include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can also reduce a fever. Aspirin can help, but it is not suitable for children, and it may not be suitable for people who take blood thinners. NSAIDs and Tylenol are available to purchase over the counter or online.If a person is sweating a lot, they may experience dehydration. In this case, they should consume plenty of fluids to prevent complications.Treating the causeA fever is a symptom, not an illness. A doctor may wish to carry out tests to identify the cause. If the fever is due to a bacterial infection, they may prescribe an antibiotic.If it stems from a viral infection, the doctor may recommend using NSAIDs to relieve the symptoms. Antibiotics will not stop a virus. A doctor will not prescribe them for a viral infection.NSAIDs will not help if the fever is due to hot weather or sustained strenuous exercise. In these cases, it is essential to cool the person down. If they are confused or unconscious, they need immediate medical care.COVID-19A person with symptoms of COVID-19 may not need any medical treatment. However, if they develop severe chest pains and have difficulty breathing, they may need hospital treatment. Some people will need to spend time on a ventilator, which is a device that will help them breathe.CausesFevers can result from various factors, including:an infection, such as strep throat, the flu, chickenpox, pneumonia, or COVID-19rheumatoid arthritissome medicationsoverexposing the skin to sunlight, or sunburnheatstroke, either due to high ambient temperatures or prolonged strenuous exercisedehydrationsilicosis, which is a type of lung disease caused by long-term exposure to silica dustamphetamine abusealcohol withdrawalIn childrenChildren with a high temperature may develop a febrile seizure. These are most likely to occur between the ages of 12 and 18 months.These often result from an ear infection, gastroenteritis, or a respiratory virus, and they are not usually serious. Less commonly, they may stem from a more severe illness, such as meningitis, a kidney infection, or pneumonia.Seizures can occur when the body temperature rises quickly.There are two types of febrile seizure: simple febrile seizures and complex febrile seizures.Simple febrile seizuresThis type of febrile seizure can last from a few seconds up to 15 minutes. However, it usually lasts less than 5 minutes. It does not occur again during a 24-hour period. Around 8085% of febrile seizures are of this type.It typically involves the whole body, and symptoms include:stiffness in the bodytwitching in the arms and legsa loss of consciousness while the eyes stay openThere may also be: irregular breathingurination, defecation, or bothvomitingComplex febrile seizuresThis type of febrile seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes, comes back more often, and tends to affect only a part of the body, rather than the whole body.Complex febrile seizures are more serious than simple febrile seizures. A child who has a complex febrile seizure is more likely to experience epilepsy as they grow older.In fact, around 3040% of children who have either type of seizure will have other similar seizures at a later date.When to see a doctorIn most cases, a child who has a seizure should see a doctor. The doctor may suggest controlling their temperature with acetaminophen and ensuring that they drink plenty of fluids. If necessary, they may also prescribe an anticonvulsant, such as sodium valproate or clonazepam.DiagnosisA fever is a symptom, not an illness. A doctor can diagnose a fever by checking the persons body temperature, but they will also need to diagnose the reason for the fever.To do so, they will examine the individual and ask them about any other symptoms and their medical history. If the person has recently experienced another infection, if they have recently had surgery, or if there is pain or swelling in one area, it may indicate what kind of infection is likely to be present.To confirm a diagnosis, the doctor may recommend: a blood testa urine testimaging testsThe treatment they prescribe will depend on the cause of the fever.PreventionTo prevent a fever, people should follow the usual steps for reducing the risk of an infection.These include regular hand-washing and staying away from people who are unwell.Preventing COVID-19To reduce the risk of transmitting or contracting COVID-19, the CDC recommend: washing the hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds each timeusing hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not availablenot touching the face with unwashed handscovering the face with a mask or cloth covering when near other people, except for children under 2 yearscleaning and disinfecting surfaces regularlycoughing and sneezing into a tissue, then disposing of the tissue and washing the handsavoiding close contact with people who are unwellFor information on how to make and wear a face mask, see the CDCs advice here.SummaryA fever is usually a symptom of an infection. It is not usually a cause for concern, but the underlying illness may need medical treatment. Often, a fever will resolve without medical attention. However, if a child or an older adult has a fever, if the individual has other severe or worsening symptoms, or if they have a weakened immune system, they should seek medical help.If a person has a dry cough with a fever, they may have COVID-19. If they start to experience difficulty breathing, someone should call 911 and ask for emergency help.

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm  or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs)  also known as your body's "thermostat"  monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children.

Medical News TodayHealth ConditionsHealth ProductsDiscoverToolsConnectSubscribeWhen is a fever in adults serious?Medically reviewed by Alana Biggers, M.D., MPH  Written by Rachel Nall, MSN, CRNA
on March 31, 2020When to seek helpNormalTypes and causesComplicationsCOVID-19TreatmentPreventionSummarySevere illness can cause extremely high temperatures in adults that can be life threatening. A high-grade fever from a rectal measurement is typically 104.1106.0°F (4041.1°C).When certain pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, enter the body, the immune system signals the body to increase its temperature in an attempt to destroy them.This article will discuss how a fever affects an adults body and when it is cause for concern.If a person is concerned about a fever or how they feel overall, they should talk to a doctor.When is a fever serious?Share on PinterestDoctors consider a temperature above 104°F (40°C) to be a high-grade fever.As a general rule, adults should consider seeking medical attention if their temperature reaches above 104 °F (40°C). Doctors consider this temperature to be a high-grade fever.However, a fever is not the only symptom a person has when they are ill. A person should consider other symptoms, such as vomiting, breathing issues, confusion, or how they feel overall when deciding whether they need medical attention. Normal body temperaturesDoctors categorize a fever by the reading on the thermometer, how long the fever lasts, and whether it keeps going up and down.Normal body temperature can fluctuate. According to a 2019 systematic review, typical body temperatures vary according to a persons age, and whether they take their temperature orally or rectally. The table below indicates a range of normal body temperatures.AgesOral °F (°C)Rectal °F (°C)Mean temperature97.8 (36.5)98.6 (37.0)Less than 60 years of age98.1 (36.7)98.8 (37.1)Over 60 years of age97.5 (36.4)98.6 (37.0)It is important to note that temperatures can fluctuate. A normal rectal body temperature ranges from 98.6100.4°F.Types and causes of feverThe following are the classifications of body temperature ranges, according to an article in the Journal of Infection and Public Health: Mild or low-grade fever: 100.4102.2°F (3839°C)Moderate grade fever: 102.2104.0°F (39°C40°C)High-grade fever: 104.1106.0°F (40°C41.1°C)These temperature values are rectal measurements, which doctors consider the most accurate. However, the article also emphasizes that doctors can better diagnose a persons condition by considering their other symptoms rather than the severity of their temperature. Sustained or continuous feverA sustained fever is when a person has a temperature above normal that does not fluctuate by more than 1.5°F (1°C) for 24 hours. Causes may include:Gram-negative bacteria: These are bacteria that can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and surgical site infections.Typhoid: Typhoid is a bacterial infection that can cause fever.Acute bacterial meningitis: This is a severe infection that requires emergency medical help.Urinary tract infection (UTI): Cystitis is an infection of the bladder, and urethritis is an infection of the urethra.Intermittent feverAn intermittent fever occurs when a person experiences a raised temperature for several hours a day. The temperature then goes back to normal before spiking again. Common causes may include:Malaria: This is an infection that some mosquitoes transmit.Tuberculosis (TB): This is an infection of the lungs.Lymphoma: This is a form of cancer that begins in the cells.Sepsis: This occurs when the body has an extreme reaction to an infection.Remittent feverThis is a daily fever that is always higher than normal but may fluctuate as much as 3.6°F (2°C) throughout the day. Common causes may include:Infective endocarditis: This is an infection of the endocardium, which is the membrane that lines the inside of the heart.Rickettsiae infections: This is an infection transmitted by ticks, mites, and lice.Potential complicationsPeople who experience an internal temperature of 104°F (40°C) and higher for prolonged periods can develop hyperthermia. For this reason, it is essential to try to keep a fever from becoming too high.Potential complications from a high-grade fever can include:seizuresunsteadinessunconsciousnesslethargycomaA high-grade fever can also cause cognitive dysfunction, which affects a persons memory, comprehension, reasoning, and problem-solving ability. Some people may also have difficulty paying attention. Typically, these symptoms are only temporary, and most people recover. However, in extreme circumstances, some people experience permanent changes.Fever and COVID-19Fever is a common symptom of the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19. According to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February 2020, data on 1,099 people in China who had COVID-19 showed that 43.8% had a fever on admission to the hospital. An estimated 88.7% developed a fever during their hospitalization. The authors defined a fever as an axillary (armpit) temperature of 99.8°F (37.7°C) or higher. Other symptoms include:a coughshortness of breathnauseavomitingdiarrheaIf a person suspects they may have COVID-19, they should call a doctor or health department for further testing. For live updates on the latest developments regarding the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, click here.TreatmentA low-grade fever can be the bodys protective measure. Scientists are still in debate whether a person should treat a low-grade fever.However, if a person does have a fever or does not feel well, they could take fever-reducing medications, such as: acetaminophenibuprofen aspirinAs a fever is typically a symptom of another condition, a person may require different treatments depending on the cause. If a person has an underlying bacterial illness, a doctor may prescribe antibiotics. These can treat the infection, which can help reduce fever. Other steps a person can take to make themselves more comfortable include resting, drinking plenty of fluids, wearing loose clothing, and taking cool or lukewarm baths. PreventionThere are some steps a person can take to help prevent getting a fever:Always cover the mouth and nose when sneezing and wash hands immediately after sneezing or coughing. Refrain from sharing personal items, such as utensils, cups, and even toothbrushes. Try not to touch the face. A person can easily transmit the pathogen from their face to their nose or mouth, which might allow the germs to enter the body. Avoid contact with people who are sick. This can help prevent the transmission of illness.Maintain good hygiene. Washing hands may help prevent bacteria and viruses from spreading. Learn more about washing hands properly here.Summary A fever is a protective mechanism for the body as the immune system works to fight against illness in a variety of ways. If a person feels very unwell in addition to having a fever or they are already immunocompromised due to pre-existing conditions, they should seek medical attention. A person should also see their doctor if they have tried to control their fever at home, but over-the-counter medicines and other treatments are ineffective. A fever can become dangerous if it reaches 104°F (40°C) or higher.

Fever in adults: When to worry
Infection is a common cause of fever, but other conditions can also bring the heat.
May 22, 2023
Reviewed by
Howard E. LeWine, MD,
Chief Medical Editor, Harvard Health Publishing
Fever is one of the body's most effective ways of fighting infection. It is part of your body's defense against infection-causing germs.
You get a fever most often when your body is trying to kill infectious invaders such as viruses or bacteria. A higher body temperature helps the immune system respond more vigorously to the attack, and makes it harder for these microbes to survive.
What is considered a fever in adults?
The average body temperature is 98.6° F (37°C). But "normal" body temperature varies from person to person. It also changes during the day, rising a bit after you eat or exercise. Body temperature is often higher in the afternoon than it is when you wake up in the morning.
Fever means a body temperature of 100.4° F (38°C) or higher.
High fever in adults
While any temperature above your normal temperature range is considered a fever, there are different levels of fever severity:
Low-grade: 99.1 to 100.4 F (37.3 to 38.0 C)
Moderate-grade: 100.6 to 102.2 F (38.1 to 39.0 C)
High-grade: 102.4 to 105.8 F (39.1 to 41 C).
When to worry about fever
If you have a fever over 104°F (40°C), you should call your doctor.
Seek medical help right away if you have a fever along with any of these symptoms:
seizure
loss of consciousness
confusion
stiff neck
trouble breathing
severe pain anywhere in the body
swelling or inflammation of any part of the body
vaginal discharge that is discolored or smells bad
pain when urinating or urine that smells bad.
Causes of fever
An infection, such as the flu, is the most common cause of fever.
Other conditions can also cause a fever. These include diseases that produce inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis; reactions to drugs or vaccines; and even certain types of cancers.
Accompanying symptoms
The following symptoms may also accompany fever:
sweats
chills
headache
achy muscles
lack of desire to eat
rash
restlessness
weakness.
A very high fever can cause confusion, extreme sleepiness, irritability, and seizures.
Diagnosing the cause of a fever
To help determine why you have a fever, your doctor will ask you about:
other symptoms such as coughing, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or pain when urinating
recent surgeries or injuries
recent vaccinations
new drugs you may be taking
recent travel, particularly travel abroad.
How to treat a fever at home
By itself, fever is usually harmless, though a high fever can be miserable. These steps may help you feel better:
Drink plenty of fluids to help cool your body and prevent dehydration.
Eat light foods that are easy to digest.
Get plenty of rest.
Take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, or others), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn, or others), or acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) to help relieve head and body aches and lower your temperature.
Take a slightly warm (not cool) bath, or apply damp washcloths to the forehead and wrists.

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm  or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs)  also known as your body's "thermostat"  monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children.

Most providers say a fever is either 100.0 F (37.8 C) or 100.4 F (38 C). When you have a fever, its your bodys normal response to fighting an infection or illness. Fevers usually arent a serious concern. They typically go away when the infection passes.ContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat is a fever?A fever is when your body temperature rises higher than normal. A fever itself isnt an illness. Rather, its a symptom of a wide range of health conditions. When your body temperature rises a few degrees above normal, it can be a sign that your immune system has been activated, often to fight an infection. It can also be a side effect of some medications and vaccinations.What is considered a fever?Common knowledge states that a normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). But your baseline body temperature may vary by a degree or more. It also fluctuates. Its typically lower in the morning and higher in the evening. Its higher during certain points of your menstrual cycle and when youre exercising.Infants and young children normally have slightly higher body temperatures than older children and adults. So infants and younger children have slightly higher fever temperatures.There are no strict guidelines for what temperature is a fever, because body temperature varies by person, time of day and method of measurement. But healthcare providers most often say a fever temperature is 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) when measured orally (by mouth).Rectal and ear thermometers typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) higher than oral thermometers. Skin thermometers (such as forehead thermometers) typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) lower than oral thermometers.What is a low-grade fever?A low-grade fever means a body temperature slightly above normal. This type of fever can be a sign your immune system has been mildly activated. Theres no standard low-grade fever range. But many healthcare providers consider a body temperature between 99.5 degrees F (37.5 degrees C) and 100.3 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) to be a low-grade fever.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat are fever symptoms?In addition to an elevated temperature, you may experience the following symptoms:Chills, feeling cold, shivering and shaking.Body aches and headaches.Fatigue (tiredness).On and off or constant sweating.Flushed complexion or hot skin.Faster heart beats.Additional fever symptoms in babies and children may include:Lack of appetite  not eating and drinking well.Earache or pulling at their ears.High-pitched crying.Fussiness.Paleness or flushness.Excessive thirst.Decreased urination.Possible CausesWhat are the most common causes of fever?A fever has many causes and can be a symptom of almost any illness. Common conditions that cause fever include:Bacterial infections.Viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19.Gastrointestinal (GI) infections.Urinary tract infections.Skin infections.You may also develop a fever due to:A reaction to certain medications.Vaccinations.Autoimmune disorders.Cancer.Can allergies cause fever?Allergies can cause cold-like symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes, but they typically dont cause fever. Despite its name, hay fever (also called allergic rhinitis) doesnt cause fever.AdvertisementCare and TreatmentWhats the best way to measure body temperature?You can take your temperature in several different parts of your body. The most common site is your mouth (oral temperature). Other sites include your ear (tympanic membrane), forehead (temporal artery) and armpit (axillary). The most accurate site is the rectum, and the least accurate site is the armpit.The best way to measure your temperature is with a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers contain mercury and providers no longer recommend them.How can I break a fever at home?If your fever is mild  less than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C)  you usually dont need treatment with medication. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. Taking a lukewarm bath  about 98 degrees F (36.7 degrees C)  may also help bring your bodys temperature down. Keep an eye on signs of dehydration and other worsening symptoms.If youre feeling uncomfortable and your temperature is higher than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C), you can try to break the fever. The most common way to get rid of a fever is to use over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.Dont give aspirin to children under the age of 17. Aspirin in children may cause Reyes syndrome, a sometimes fatal illness.Does ibuprofen reduce fever?Yes, you can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen to try to reduce a fever.How long does a fever last?The cause of the fever determines how long itll last. Typically, if an infection is the cause of your fever, it should pass within three to four days. Call your healthcare provider if the fever lingers longer than that or comes along with breathing changes.AdvertisementCan fevers be prevented?You can prevent some fevers by avoiding the illnesses and infections that cause them. Sometimes, children develop fevers after receiving vaccinations. You can prevent these types of fevers by giving your child acetaminophen just before or after the vaccination. But you cant prevent most fevers. Theyre typically a sign that your body is doing what its supposed to do.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentWhen To Call the DoctorWhen should a fever be treated by a healthcare provider?In adults, fevers less than 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) typically arent dangerous and arent a cause for concern. If your fever rises above that level, make a call to your healthcare provider for treatment.In children, call your childs healthcare provider if:Their fever lasts more than five days.Their fever is higher than 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen dont break the fever.Youre concerned they arent behaving normally.They have any problems breathing or urinating.When should I go to the ER?If you have a fever along with any of the following symptoms, go to your nearest emergency room or call 911. It may be a sign of a serious or life-threatening illness.Pain or tenderness in your belly (abdomen).Nausea or vomiting.Severe headache.Stiff neck.Light irritates your eyes (photophobia).Convulsions or seizures.Difficulty breathing.Strange behavior and/or altered speech.Confusion or irritability.Difficulty waking or extreme sleepiness.Fever rash (small bleeding spots under your skin).When should I take my child to the ER?If your baby has a fever and is under 3 months of age, take them to the ER right away. Your babys immune system hasnt developed fully yet, and they could have a serious infection.If your child has a fever along with any of the following symptoms, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room:Extreme sluggishness or drowsiness.Lack of appetite.Excessive drooling or difficulty swallowing.Continuous crying.Stiff neck.Fever rash.Difficulty breathing.Severe abdominal pain.Redness or swelling.Dehydration (not drinking many fluids).Decreased urination.What are the possible complications or risks of not treating a fever?Untreated fevers above 105.8 degrees F (41 degrees C) can be dangerous. If your body temperature reaches this level, your organs will begin to malfunction and will eventually fail.Even moderate fevers can be dangerous for adults with lung or heart disorders because fever causes your breathing rate and heart rate to increase. Fever can also worsen the mental state of people with dementia.Additional Common QuestionsWhat is a recurrent fever?A recurrent fever is a fever that keeps coming back multiple times over a period of time. Providers call these fevers episodic because they come and go. The fever lasts for a few days and then goes away for a stretch of time. Your child is healthy and acts normally between fevers. Recurrent fevers affect young children under the age of 5 most often. Theyre one of the main symptoms of a collection of conditions called periodic fever syndromes.What is a febrile seizure?Some children have a side effect of fevers called febrile seizures. This happens in 2% to 4% of children under the age of 5. Some seizures cause jerking movements, or it may look like your child has passed out. When this happens, put your child on their side and dont put anything in their mouth. Call 911 if the seizure lasts for more than five minutes and/or your childs lips turn blue.If the seizure lasts less than five minutes, notify their healthcare provider and get medical attention right away.What is a fever dream?Fever dreams are vivid, bizarre or unpleasant dreams you may experience when your body temperature rises higher than normal. Researchers dont know the exact cause of fever dreams. But some scientists think fevers cause your brain to overheat, affecting your cognitive processing, which results in dreams stranger than your typical dreams. Fevers may also interrupt your REM sleep cycle, which can lead to unusual dreams.A note from Cleveland ClinicWhile a fever can be uncomfortable, its typically a sign that your body is working properly and your immune system is kicking into action. You dont need to treat low fevers, but you can take over-the-counter pain relievers until they pass. If you or your child has a higher temperature or your fever hasnt passed within a few days, you should make a call to your healthcare provider. While infections most often cause fevers, there could be other underlying conditions youll want to get checked out.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 05/31/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

It is a common sign of an infection.As a persons body temperature increases, they may feel cold until it levels off and stops rising. People describe this as chills.Eating, exercise, sleeping, the time of day, and individual factors can also affect temperature. When an infection occurs, the immune system will launch an attack to try to remove the cause. A high body temperature is a normal part of this reaction. A fever will usually resolve on its own. However, if body temperature rises too high, it may be a symptom of a severe infection that needs medical treatment. In this case, a doctor may recommend medication to reduce it.Read on to learn more about the symptoms of a fever, as well as some causes and treatment options.SymptomsShare on PinterestA fever is a common sign of an infection.When someone has a fever, they may also:shiver and feel cold when nobody else doessweathave a low appetiteshow signs of dehydrationhave increased sensitivity to painlack energy and feel sleepyhave difficulty concentratingIf a baby has a fever, they may:feel hot to the touchhave flushed cheeksbe sweaty or clammyWith a high fever, there may also be irritability, confusion, delirium, and seizures.COVID-19 symptomsIf a person has a fever with a dry cough, they may have symptoms of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urge people with these symptoms to stay at home and away from other people. The person should also wear a face covering if other people are near.In many cases, the symptoms will improve without specialist treatment. However, if the person also develops severe chest pain or difficulty breathing, they should call 911 and ask for medical help. Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, most people now use a digital thermometer. Experts do not recommend using a glass thermometer, as these can be dangerous. Some people use a forehead strip, but these may be less accurate.A person can put a thermometer under their arm or in their mouth.To use a digital device: Clean the tip using cold water and soap, and then rinse it.Turn on the device.Place the tip under the tongue, toward the back of the mouth, and close the mouth. Or, place it under the armpit and hold the device close to the body.Wait until there is a flash or the thermometer beeps.Read the temperature.Normal armpit temperature will be around 0.5 to 0.9ºF (0.3 to 0.5°C) lower than oral temperature.If the reading is 100.4°F (38°C) or above, the person has a fever. Thermometers are available for purchase over the counter or online.Is it possible to take someones temperature without a thermometer? Find out here.When should I worry?Doctors classify fevers according to how long they last, whether or not they come and go, and how high they are.SeverityCore body temperature varies from person to person.Most experts consider a temperature of 100.4° F (38°C) to be a fever, but in children, this may be lower, at 99.5°F (37.5°C).Hyperpyrexia can occur when a persons temperature rises above 106°F (41.1°C). Without treatment, this can lead to complications.Learn more about normal body temperature and when a person should worry here.DurationA fever can be:acute if it lasts for under 7 dayssubacute if it lasts for up to 14 dayschronic or persistent if it lasts for over 14 daysFevers that exist for days or weeks with no explanation are called fevers of unknown origin.TreatmentA mild fever is part of the immune systems response to bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. It helps the body fight off infection.However, it can be uncomfortable, and a high fever can sometimes lead to complications. For this reason, doctors may sometimes recommend medications called antipyretics to lower a persons temperature.Examples include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can also reduce a fever. Aspirin can help, but it is not suitable for children, and it may not be suitable for people who take blood thinners. NSAIDs and Tylenol are available to purchase over the counter or online.If a person is sweating a lot, they may experience dehydration. In this case, they should consume plenty of fluids to prevent complications.Treating the causeA fever is a symptom, not an illness. A doctor may wish to carry out tests to identify the cause. If the fever is due to a bacterial infection, they may prescribe an antibiotic.If it stems from a viral infection, the doctor may recommend using NSAIDs to relieve the symptoms. Antibiotics will not stop a virus. A doctor will not prescribe them for a viral infection.NSAIDs will not help if the fever is due to hot weather or sustained strenuous exercise. In these cases, it is essential to cool the person down. If they are confused or unconscious, they need immediate medical care.COVID-19A person with symptoms of COVID-19 may not need any medical treatment. However, if they develop severe chest pains and have difficulty breathing, they may need hospital treatment. Some people will need to spend time on a ventilator, which is a device that will help them breathe.CausesFevers can result from various factors, including:an infection, such as strep throat, the flu, chickenpox, pneumonia, or COVID-19rheumatoid arthritissome medicationsoverexposing the skin to sunlight, or sunburnheatstroke, either due to high ambient temperatures or prolonged strenuous exercisedehydrationsilicosis, which is a type of lung disease caused by long-term exposure to silica dustamphetamine abusealcohol withdrawalIn childrenChildren with a high temperature may develop a febrile seizure. These are most likely to occur between the ages of 12 and 18 months.These often result from an ear infection, gastroenteritis, or a respiratory virus, and they are not usually serious. Less commonly, they may stem from a more severe illness, such as meningitis, a kidney infection, or pneumonia.Seizures can occur when the body temperature rises quickly.There are two types of febrile seizure: simple febrile seizures and complex febrile seizures.Simple febrile seizuresThis type of febrile seizure can last from a few seconds up to 15 minutes. However, it usually lasts less than 5 minutes. It does not occur again during a 24-hour period. Around 8085% of febrile seizures are of this type.It typically involves the whole body, and symptoms include:stiffness in the bodytwitching in the arms and legsa loss of consciousness while the eyes stay openThere may also be: irregular breathingurination, defecation, or bothvomitingComplex febrile seizuresThis type of febrile seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes, comes back more often, and tends to affect only a part of the body, rather than the whole body.Complex febrile seizures are more serious than simple febrile seizures. A child who has a complex febrile seizure is more likely to experience epilepsy as they grow older.In fact, around 3040% of children who have either type of seizure will have other similar seizures at a later date.When to see a doctorIn most cases, a child who has a seizure should see a doctor. The doctor may suggest controlling their temperature with acetaminophen and ensuring that they drink plenty of fluids. If necessary, they may also prescribe an anticonvulsant, such as sodium valproate or clonazepam.DiagnosisA fever is a symptom, not an illness. A doctor can diagnose a fever by checking the persons body temperature, but they will also need to diagnose the reason for the fever.To do so, they will examine the individual and ask them about any other symptoms and their medical history. If the person has recently experienced another infection, if they have recently had surgery, or if there is pain or swelling in one area, it may indicate what kind of infection is likely to be present.To confirm a diagnosis, the doctor may recommend: a blood testa urine testimaging testsThe treatment they prescribe will depend on the cause of the fever.PreventionTo prevent a fever, people should follow the usual steps for reducing the risk of an infection.These include regular hand-washing and staying away from people who are unwell.Preventing COVID-19To reduce the risk of transmitting or contracting COVID-19, the CDC recommend: washing the hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds each timeusing hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not availablenot touching the face with unwashed handscovering the face with a mask or cloth covering when near other people, except for children under 2 yearscleaning and disinfecting surfaces regularlycoughing and sneezing into a tissue, then disposing of the tissue and washing the handsavoiding close contact with people who are unwellFor information on how to make and wear a face mask, see the CDCs advice here.SummaryA fever is usually a symptom of an infection. It is not usually a cause for concern, but the underlying illness may need medical treatment. Often, a fever will resolve without medical attention. However, if a child or an older adult has a fever, if the individual has other severe or worsening symptoms, or if they have a weakened immune system, they should seek medical help.If a person has a dry cough with a fever, they may have COVID-19. If they start to experience difficulty breathing, someone should call 911 and ask for emergency help.

A fever is a sure sign your body is fighting off some type of infection. (Photo credit: E+/Getty Images)
A fever is when you have a brief rise in body temperature thats higher than your normal body temperature. Its also called a high temperature, hyperthermia, or pyrexia. It's usually a sign your immune system is working to fight some type of infection. Fever temperaturesNormal body temperatures are different for everyone, but they usually fall within the range of 97 to 99 degrees F. A temperature of 100.4 or higher is considered a fever, but there is no medical standard. The type of thermometer you use affects the temperature you get, as some are more accurate than others. Here's a breakdown of what's considered a fever by age and temperature: Babies age 0-2 years100.4 F (rectal, forehead, or ear temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature)Children ages 2-5 years100.4 F (rectal, forehead, or ear temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature)Children ages 5 and older100.4 F (ear temperature)100 F (oral temperature)99 F (under the arm temperature) Adults100.4 F (oral temperature)A low-grade fever is when you have a temperature that is slightly higher than normal, usually around 99.5 to 100.3 F. A low-grade fever signals that something is going on to activate your immune system.When Is Fever Dangerous?A fever can make you uncomfortable, but it's generally not cause for concern. You can often manage a fever at home, but in some cases you should call your doctor. Fever in babies: When to worryCheck in with your doctor if your baby younger than 3 months:Has a rectal temperature higher than 100.4 F. Has fever higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Has other symptoms, such as a cough or diarrhea.Call 911 or go to the ER if your baby has a seizure.Check in with your doctor if your baby 3 to 6 months old: Has a rectal or oral temperature higher than 100.4 F and is also irritable or sleepy.Has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Call your doctor or go to the ER if your baby won't stop crying and cant be consoled.  Fever in children: When to worryYou should reach out to your pediatrician if your child 6 months to 2 years:Has a fever higher than 102 F for more than 1 day. Has other symptoms, such as a cough or diarrhea.If their fever comes with rash, real discomfort, irritability, low energy, headache, stiff neck, or repeated diarrhea or vomiting.Their fever is higher than 104 F, which can cause a seizure.Call 911 or go to the ER if your child has a seizure.Their fever doesnt go down after taking over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen.They've recently had vaccines.Fever in adults: When to worryCall your doctor or visit urgent care or an emergency room if:You have a temperature of 103 F or higher.Your fever doesnt go down after taking over-the-counter medications, such as ibuprofen.Youve been in contact with someone who has COVID-19.If you have a fever that is 102 degrees or higher, especially if you're in your first trimester of pregnancy. When to call the doctorCall 911 if you or your child have any of these symptoms:UnresponsiveWheezing or difficulty breathingBlue lipsConvulsions or seizuresSpeaking in a confused way A fever with a stiff neck or headacheTemperature higher than 105 FFever with sudden onset of rashSevere stomach pain or persistent vomitingSkin rashes, blisters, or a red streak on an arm or legA severe sore throat, swelling of the throat, or earachePain with urination (peeing), back pain, or shaking chillsA serious cough, or coughing up bloodContact your doctor if your fever lasts for more than 3 days or gets worse.Fever SymptomsA fever is a sign of an illness or infection. When you have one, you may notice these symptoms:Chills or shiveringSweatingBody achesHeadacheLethargy (feeling weak)Being irritableLoss of appetiteDehydrationRed or flushed faceBabies and children might also have:Earache (or pulling at their ears)High-pitch criesLoss of appetiteExtra thirstLow urine output (peeing less than usual)What Causes Fever?A fever can be a sign of several health conditions, which may or may not need medical treatment.The most common causes are infections such as colds and stomach bugs (gastroenteritis). Other causes include:Infections of the ear, lung, skin, throat, bladder, or kidneyHeat exhaustionViral infections like the flu or COVID-19SunburnConditions that cause inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritisSide effects of medicationsVaccines and immunizationsBlood clotsAutoimmune conditions such as lupus and inflammatory bowel disease (IBS)CancerHormone disorders such as hyperthyroidismIllegal drugs such as amphetamines and cocaineTeething in babies can cause a mild, low-grade fever (not over 101 degrees).Fever DiagnosisAlthough a fever is easy to measure with a thermometer, finding its cause can be hard. If you see your doctor, they'll do a physical exam and ask questions about your symptoms, other health conditions you have, medications you take, and if you've recently traveled to areas that have health risks. A malaria infection, for example, may cause a high fever that gets better and then comes back in cycles. Some areas of the U.S. are hot spots for infections such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Your doctor may ask if you have been around someone with COVID-19 or have any other symptoms of COVID-19.Sometimes, you may have a "fever of unknown origin." That means whatever's causing your fever isn't clear. Instead, it could be more unusual like a connective tissue disorder (diseases that affect things like your tendons, ligaments, skin, or cartilage), cancer, or another health problem. Your doctor may need to run tests to figure out the cause.Fever TreatmentsThe most common treatments for fever include over-the-counter drugs such as acetaminophen  and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen. Talk to your doctor about the proper dosage. Never give young children and teens aspirin. It's linked to a rare condition called Reyes syndrome that could damage their liver and brain.What is the best way to treat a fever at home?Drink a lot of clear liquids such as water, broth, and juices. Take a lukewarm bath. Do not use cold water or alcohol.Get plenty of rest. Keep yourself cool with lightweight clothing and bed coverings.If you get the chills, use an extra blanket until they go away.Types of FeverFevers have a wide range of causes, and you might hear your doctor call your fever a certain name. That's because doctors classify five types of fevers based on their patterns.Intermittent. With this type of fever, your temperature rises, but falls back to a normal range during the day. The difference can range from a small increase to about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Remittent. This type of fever rises and falls, but your temperature always stays above normal. Continuous or sustained. Your temperature stays about the same throughout the day. Hectic. This causes big swings in temperature, about 2 degrees F or more, throughout the day. You may also have symptoms like chills and sweats. Relapsing. A relapsing fever spikes after a few days or even weeks of normal temperature. Fever ComplicationsMost fevers get better without any problems, but some can have rare complications, especially in young children.If your child is aged 6 months to 5 years, a fever could put them at risk of a febrile seizure. They usually occur when your child's fever is higher than 100.4 F.  Signs your child could be having a febrile seizure include: They lose consciousness.Their arms and legs shake.Stiff or twitching one side of their body.Febrile seizures usually happen within the first 24 hours of your child's fever, and they might be the first sign your child is sick. Call 911 or your doctor immediately, even if the seizure lasts just a few seconds.  Sources

Bush, MD, FACP, Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine, Florida Atlantic
UniversityReviewed/Revised Jul 2024VIEW PROFESSIONAL VERSIONGET THE QUICK FACTSCauses|Evaluation|Treatment|Essentials for Older People|Key Points|Fever is an elevated body temperature that occurs when the body's thermostat (located in the hypothalamus in the brain) resets at a higher temperature, primarily in response to an infection. Elevated body temperature that is not caused by a resetting of the temperature set point is called hyperthermia. Although 98.6° F (37° C) is considered normal temperature, body temperature varies throughout the day. It is lowest in the early morning and highest in the late afternoonsometimes reaching 99.9° F (37.7° C). Similarly, a fever does not stay at a constant temperature. Sometimes temperature peaks every day and then returns to normal. This process is called intermittent fever. Alternatively, temperature varies but does not return to normal. This process is called remittent fever. Doctors no longer think that the pattern of the rise and fall of fever is very important in the diagnosis of certain disorders.Body temperature can be measured at several areas of the body. The most common sites are the mouth (oral temperature) and rectum (rectal temperature). Other sites include the ear, forehead, and, much less preferably, armpit. Temperature is typically measured using a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers containing mercury are not recommended because they can break and expose people to mercury.Oral temperatures are considered elevated whenThey are higher than 99° F (37° C) in the early morning.They are higher than 100.4° F (38° C) at any time after the early morning.They are higher than a persons known normal everyday temperature.Rectal and ear temperatures are about 1.0° F (0.6° C) higher than oral temperatures. Skin temperatures (for example, the forehead) are about 1.0° F (0.6° C) lower than oral temperatures. Many people use the term fever loosely, often meaning that they feel too warm, too cold, or sweaty, but they have not actually measured their temperature.The ability to generate a fever is reduced in certain people (for example, those who are very old, very young, or who have an alcohol use disorder).(See also Overview of Infectious Disease and Fever in Infants and Children.)Consequences of feverThe symptoms people have are due mainly to the condition causing the fever rather than the fever itself.Although many people worry that fever can cause harm, the typical temporary elevations in body temperature ranging from 100.4° to 104° F (38° to 40° C) caused by most short-lived (acute) infections are well-tolerated by healthy adults. As one of the body's defenses against an infection, a fever can trigger the production of antibodies and make it more difficult for microorganisms to grow, and may lessen the severity of an infection and help it go away. However, a moderate fever may be slightly dangerous for adults with a heart or lung disorder because fever causes the heart rate and breathing rate to increase. Fever can also worsen mental status in people with dementia.Additionally, an extreme temperature elevation (typically more than 105.8° F, or 41° C) may be damaging. A body temperature this high can cause malfunction and ultimately failure of most organs. Such extreme elevation sometimes results from very severe infection (such as sepsis, malaria, or meningitis) but is more typically caused by heatstroke or use of certain illicit drugs (such as
or PCP).Fever in healthy children can cause febrile seizures.Causes of Fever in AdultsSubstances that cause fever are called pyrogens. Pyrogens can come from inside or outside the body. Microorganisms and the substances they produce (such as toxins) are examples of pyrogens formed outside the body. Pyrogens formed inside the body are usually produced by 2 types of white blood cells called monocytes and macrophages. Pyrogens from outside the body can cause fever by stimulating the body to release its own pyrogens or by directly affecting the area of the brain that controls temperature.Many disorders can cause fever. They are broadly categorized asInfectious (most common)Neoplastic (cancer)Inflammatory (including autoimmune disorders, allergic reactions, and some drug reactions)An infectious cause is highly likely in adults with a fever that lasts 4 days or less (called an acute fever). An acute fever in people with cancer or a known inflammatory disorder also is most likely to have an infectious cause. In healthy people, an acute fever is unlikely to be the first sign of a chronic illness. A noninfectious cause is more likely to cause fever that lasts a long time or returns. Infectious causesInfections are the most common causes of fever. Infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Virtually all infections can cause fever, but, overall, the most likely infectious causes are the following:Upper and lower respiratory tract infectionsGastrointestinal infectionsUrinary tract infections (UTIs)Skin infectionsMost acute respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections are viral.Neoplastic causesMany cancers cause fever, for example, leukemia, lymphoma, and kidney cancer. Inflammatory causesInflammatory disorders that cause fever include systemic rheumatic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), and giant cell arteritis. Fever may also result from an allergic reaction.Medications and drugs sometimes cause fever. For example, beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin) and sulfa medications can trigger a fever. Certain illicit drugs (such as , amphetamines, or phencyclidine) and medications such as anesthetics and antipsychotics can cause an extremely high temperature.Risk factorsCertain factors help doctors determine what is the most likely cause of fever in a person. These factors include the following:The person's health status, age, and occupationHospitalizationUse of certain medications or illicit drugsExposure to infections (for example, through travel or contact with infected people, animals, or insects)Table Some Causes of Fever Based on Risk FactorsRisk FactorCauseNone (healthy)Upper or lower respiratory tract infectionGastrointestinal infectionUrinary tract infectionSkin infectionHospitalizationBloodstream infection related to a catheter inserted in a vein (IV catheter infection)Urinary tract infection, particularly in people with a urinary catheterPneumonia, particularly in people on a ventilatorAtelectasis (collapse of part of a lung due to an airway blockage, rather than an infection)Infection or a pocket of blood (hematoma) at the site of surgeryDeep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolismDiarrhea (due to Clostridioides difficileinduced colitis)MedicationsTransfusion reactionPressure soresTravel to areas where an infection is common (endemic areas)MalariaViral hepatitisDisorders that cause diarrheaTyphoid feverZika virus, chikungunya, Ebola virus, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, measles, and yellow feverDengue feverFungal infections such as coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, or histoplasmosisRickettsial infections (such as African tick-bite fever and Mediterranean spotted fever)Exposure to insects or animals that carry disease-causing organisms, called vectors (in the United States)Ticks: Rickettsiosis, ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, babesiosis, relapsing fever, or tularemiaMosquitoes: Encephalitis caused by arboviruses, malaria, or Zika virus infection; yellow feverWild animals: Tularemia, rabies, or hantavirus infectionFleas: PlagueDomestic animals: Brucellosis, cat-scratch disease, Q fever, or toxoplasmosisBirds: Psittacosis, bird fluReptiles: Salmonella infectionBats: Rabies or histoplasmosisA weakened immune system (immunocompromise)Viruses: Varicella-zoster virus infection or cytomegalovirus infectionBacteria: Infection due to pneumococci, meningococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Nocardia, or mycobacteriaFungi: Infection due to Candida, Aspergillus, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, microsporidia, Pneumocystis jirovecii, or fungi that cause mucormycosisParasites: Infection due to Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Cryptosporidium, or Cystoisospora belliMedications and illicit drugs that can alter body temperatureAmphetaminesPhencyclidine (PCP)Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or Ecstasy)Antipsychotic medications (can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome)Anesthetics (inhaled anesthetic gases such as halothane can cause malignant hyperthermia)ThyroxineInterferons (medications that are based on substances produced by the immune system and that help block the reproduction of viruses)Medications that can trigger fever by a hypersensitivity (allergic) reactionBeta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin)Sulfa drugsPhenytoinCarbamazepineProcainamideQuinidineEvaluation of Fever in AdultsUsually, a doctor can determine that an infection is present based on a brief history, a physical examination, and occasionally a few simple tests, such as a chest x-ray and urine tests. However, sometimes the cause of fever is not readily identified.When doctors initially evaluate people with an acute fever, they focus on 2 general issues:Identifying other symptoms such as headache or cough: These symptoms help narrow the range of possible causes.Determining whether the person is seriously or chronically ill: Many of the possible acute viral infections go away on their own and also are difficult for doctors to diagnose specifically (that is, to determine exactly which virus is causing the infection). Limiting testing to people who are seriously or chronically ill can help avoid many expensive, unnecessary, and often fruitless searches.Warning signsIn people with an acute fever, certain signs and characteristics are cause for concern. They includeA change in mental function, such as confusionA headache, stiff neck, or bothFlat, small, purplish red spots on the skin (petechiae), which indicate bleeding under the skinLow blood pressureRapid heart rate or rapid breathingShortness of breath (dyspnea)A temperature that is higher than 104° F (40° C) or lower than 95° F (35° C)Recent travel to an area where a serious infectious disease such as malaria is commonRecent use of medications that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants)When to see a doctorPeople who have any warning signs should see a doctor right away. Such people typically need immediate testing and often admission to a hospital.People without warning signs should call the doctor if the fever lasts more than 24 to 48 hours. Depending on the person's age, other symptoms, and known medical conditions, the doctor may ask the person to come for evaluation or recommend treatment at home. Typically, people should see a doctor if a fever lasts more than 3 or 4 days regardless of other symptoms.What the doctor doesDoctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history. Doctors then do a physical examination. What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the fever and the tests that may need to be done.A doctor begins by asking a person about present and previous symptoms and disorders, medications currently being taken, any blood transfusions, exposure to infections, recent travel, vaccinations, and recent hospitalizations, surgeries, or other medical procedures. The pattern of the fever rarely helps the doctor make a diagnosis. However, a fever that returns every other day or every third day is typical of malaria. Doctors consider malaria and other insect-transmitted infections as a possible cause only if people have traveled to an area where the infection is common.Recent travel may give the doctor clues as to the cause of a fever because some infections occur in certain areas. For example, coccidioidomycosis (a fungal infection) occurs mostly in the southwestern United States.Recent exposures are also important. For example, people who work in a meatpacking plant are more likely to develop brucellosis (a bacterial infection spread through contact with domestic animals). Other examples include unsafe water or food (such as unpasteurized milk and milk products, and raw or undercooked meat, fish, and shellfish), insect (such as mosquitoes) and tick bites, unprotected sex, and occupational or recreational exposures (such as hunting, hiking, and water sports).Pain is an important clue to the possible source of fever, so the doctor asks about any pain in the ears, head, neck, teeth, throat, chest, abdomen, flank, rectum, muscles, and joints.Other symptoms that help determine the cause of the fever include nasal congestion and/or discharge, cough, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency, and pain while urinating). Knowing whether the person has enlarged lymph nodes or a rash (including what it looks like, where it is, and when it appeared in relation to other symptoms) may help the doctor pinpoint a cause. People with recurring fevers, night sweats, and weight loss may have a chronic infection such as tuberculosis or endocarditis (infection of the heart's lining and usually the heart valves).The doctor may also ask about the following:Contact with anyone who has an infectionAny known conditions that predispose to infection, such as HIV infection, diabetes, cancer, organ transplantation, sickle cell disease, use of an artificial pacemaker, or heart valve disorders, particularly if an artificial valve is presentAny known disorders that may cause a fever without infection, such as lupus, gout, sarcoidosis, an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), or cancerUse of any medications that may make a person susceptible to infection, such as cancer chemotherapy, corticosteroids, or other medications that suppress the immune systemUse of illicit drugs that are injectedThe physical examination begins with confirmation of fever. Fever is most accurately determined by measuring rectal temperature, but oral or ear temperature is often measured. Forehead temperature is not as accurate as rectal, but doctors may measure forehead temperature to screen people for fever. Armpit temperature is the least accurate, so doctors rarely use it to confirm a fever. Doctors then do a thorough examination from head to toe to check for a source of infection or evidence of disease.TestingThe need for testing depends on what the doctor finds during the medical history and physical examination.Otherwise healthy people who have an acute fever and only vague, general symptoms (for example, they feel generally ill or achy) probably have a viral illness that will go away without treatment. Therefore, they do not usually require testing. Exceptions are people who are in an area where COVID-19 is being spread, people who have been exposed to an animal or insect that carries and transmits a specific disease (called a vector), such as people with a tick bite, and people who have recently been in an area where a particular disorder (such as malaria) is common.If otherwise healthy people have findings that suggest a particular disorder, testing may be needed. Doctors select tests based on those findings. For example, if people have a headache and stiff neck, a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) is done to look for meningitis. If people have a cough and lung congestion, a chest x-ray is done to look for pneumonia. For certain respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19 or influenza, there are rapid molecular tests that can give results within minutes or a few hours. Some rapid tests can be done at home or in a doctor's office on a sample obtained with a cotton swab. Other rapid tests to identify a specific cause of an infection require a blood sample sent to a laboratory.People who are at increased risk of infection, people who appear seriously ill, and older adults often need testing even when findings do not suggest a particular disorder. For such people, doctors may do the following:A complete blood count (including the number and proportion of different types of white blood cells)Urine and blood culturesA chest x-rayUrinalysisLab TestComplete Blood CountLab TestUrinalysisAn increase in the white blood cell count usually indicates infection. The proportion of different types of white blood cells (differential count) gives further clues. For example, an increase in neutrophils suggests a relatively new bacterial infection. An increase in eosinophils suggests the presence of parasites, such as tapeworms or roundworms. Also, blood, urine, and other body fluids may be sent to the laboratory to try to grow the microorganism in a culture. Other blood tests can be used to detect antibodies against specific microorganisms.Fever of unknown origin (FUO)A fever of unknown origin may be diagnosed when People have a fever of at least 101° F (38.3° C) for several weeks.Extensive investigation does not detect a cause.In such cases, the cause may be an unusual chronic infection (such as tuberculosis, bacterial infection of the heart, HIV infection, cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus) or something other than an infection, such as a systemic rheumatic disorder (such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis) or cancer (such as lymphoma, ovarian cancer, or leukemia). Other causes include medication or illicit drug reactions, blood clots (deep vein thrombosis), inflammation of organ tissues (sarcoidosis), and inflammatory bowel disease.In older adults, the most common causes of FUO are giant cell arteritis, lymphomas, abscesses, and tuberculosis.Doctors usually do blood tests, including a complete blood count, blood cultures, liver blood tests, and tests to check for systemic rheumatic disorders. Other tests, such as chest x-ray, urinalysis, and urine culture, may be done.Lab TestBacteria Culture TestUltrasound studies, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly of areas that are causing discomfort, may help a doctor diagnose the cause. Radionuclide scanning, done after white blood cells labeled with a radioactive marker are injected into a vein, or positron emission tomography (PET) may be used to identify areas of infection or inflammation.If these test results are negative, doctors may need to take a sample of tissue from the liver, bone marrow, or another site of suspected infection for biopsy. The sample is then examined under a microscope, cultured, and analyzed.The treatment of FUO is focused on treating the disorder causing the fever if it is known. Doctors may give medications to lower the body temperature (see treatment of fever).Treatment of Fever in AdultsThe best fever treatment is treatment of the cause.Because fever helps the body defend against infection and because fever itself is not dangerous (unless it is higher than about 106° F [41° C]), there is some debate as to whether fever should be routinely treated. However, people with a high fever generally feel much better when the fever is treated. Plus, people with a heart or lung disorder and those with dementia are considered to be at particular risk of dangerous complications, so when they have a fever, it should be treated.Medications used to lower body temperature are called antipyretics.Because many over-the-counter cold or flu preparations contain acetaminophen, people must be careful not to take acetaminophen and one or more of these cold or flu preparations at the same time.Other cooling measures (such as cooling with a tepid water mist and using cooling blankets) are needed only if the temperature is about 106° F (41.1° C) or higher. People should not apply rubbing alcohol to their skin with a washcloth or sponge because alcohol can be absorbed through the skin and may have harmful effects.People who have a blood infection (bacteremia) or who have abnormal vital signs (such as low blood pressure and a rapid pulse and breathing rate) are admitted to the hospital.Essentials for Older People: FeverFever can be tricky in older people because the body may not respond the way it would in younger people. For example, in frail older adults, infection is less likely to cause fever. Even when elevated by infection, the temperature may be lower than the standard definition of fever, and the degree of fever may not correspond to the severity of the illness. Similarly, other symptoms, such as pain, may be less noticeable. Frequently, a change in mental function or a decline in daily functioning is the only other initial sign of pneumonia or a urinary tract infection.However, older adults with a fever are more likely to have a serious bacterial infection than are younger adults with a fever. As in younger adults, the cause is commonly a respiratory or urinary tract infection. Skin and soft-tissue infections are also common causes of fever in older adults. Older adults are more likely to have serious manifestations of respiratory viral infections such as influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Diagnosis of fever in older adults is similar to that for younger adults, except that for older adults, doctors usually recommend urine tests (including culture) and a chest x-ray. Samples of blood are cultured to rule out a blood infection (bacteremia).Key PointsMost fevers in healthy people are caused by a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection due to a virus.If people with a fever have any warning signs, they should see a doctor right away.Doctors can usually identify an infection based on a brief medical history, a physical examination, and occasionally a few simple tests, and then doctors use these results, particularly symptoms, to determine which other tests are needed.Doctors consider underlying chronic disorders, particularly those that impair the immune system, as a possible cause of fever that lasts a long time.In older adults, infections are less likely to cause fever, and other symptoms may be less noticeable.Test your KnowledgeTake a Quiz!

Fevers 101: how to treat them and when to get help
When youre feeling sick or slightly off, one of the first things you should do is use a thermometer to check your temperature.
A fever is your immune system's way of changing the battleground to help itself fight. When your body recognizes an invader (like bacteria or a virus), your immune system raises your body temperature as a defense. Your immune system works much better in hotter temperatures, while invaders do worse. Fevers may feel terrible to you, but they help your body destroy invaders and get back to its healthy self.
Fevers defined
Normal body temperatures sit between 97 F to 99 F. A fever is a temperature of 100.4F or higher. There are low-grade fevers and more serious fevers, depending on the sick person's age. A serious fever is warmer than 103F in young adults.
Which thermometer reading is best
Mouth: This is the best choice for when youre in your dorm, apartment or on campus. Oral readings are accurate and easy to take
Armpit: Placing an oral thermometer in the armpit is less accurate and will be about 1 degree lower than a mouth reading
Forehead: Though these are convenient and fast, they arent as accurate. No-touch forehead thermometers are the least accurate
Home treatments for fevers
You don't always have to treat a fever, especially if its low grade.
A fever is part of your normal immune response. Lowering your body temperature with medication can limit your immune system's fighting power. However, if your symptoms are intolerable, acetaminophen, ibuprofen or any other over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) can effectively treat a fever. You can purchase these items at the University Health Center Pharmacy.
Other at-home remedies can make you feel more comfortable and help with accompanying symptoms:
Decreasing the temperature in your dorm, apartment or home
Using a fan
Using fewer blankets or wearing fewer layers
Trying soothing honey or lemon teas
Drinking cold beverages for a sore throat
Using a humidifier for a cough
Above all, stay hydrated and get plenty of rest.
If you experience a fever, isolate and do not attend class. Remember to email your professor and let them know your situation.
When to get medical attention
Most fevers dont require medical attention. However, any of these symptoms along with a fever means it's time to seek medical help.

Fever 101: What to do and when to worry
Cold & Flu

Having a fever can leave you feeling miserable, hot and sweaty  and worried. How high is too high? When is it time to call the doctor? What do these numbers even mean?
We tend to fear fevers. However, a fever generally means your immune system is doing its job by fighting off infection. A fever is a stimulation of the immune system and is the immune systems attempt to gain advantage over bacteria or a virus.
What qualifies as a fever?
Normal body temperature for adults is about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit but given that body temperature varies, the normal range is broad. It is very normal for body temperature to range between 98.6-99.9 and these temperatures (even if they are high for you) are less likely to be a true sign of illness.
Regular body temperatures generally do not exceed 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore, a true fever is when body temperature reaches 100.4 F (38 deg C).
Parents, its easy to panic when your young child spikes a fever but first, take a deep breath. Keep in mind that kids usually spike fevers faster than adults and the temperatures tend to be higher as well; this is because children have an inexperienced immune system.
At-home fever remedies
Fortunately, for low-grade fevers, there are a few steps you can take to make yourself more comfortable at home.
Rest
Your body needs lots of rest to give your immune system a chance to recover. Keep your body cool by sleeping with light clothing.
Fluids
Fluids are essential since fevers can cause fluid loss and dehydration. For children younger than 1 year old, use oral rehydration products.
OTC medication
Fever treatment for adults usually depends on the temperature. If the temperature is below 102 degrees and there is minimal discomfort, simple over the counter ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen or aspirin should be adequate.
OTC medications should be used for children based on age and weight. Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help reduce aches and pains, but parents should follow the directions and dose very carefully. Talk to your pediatrician about any medication questions.
When to call your doctor
If your fever reaches higher than 104 degrees Fahrenheit, come in to see your doctor. Also see your doctor if you have additional symptoms such as:
Seizures
Loss of consciousness
Stiff neck
Trouble breathing
Severe pain
Swelling or inflammation in the body
Pain with urination
Any malodorous vaginal discharge
If your child is less than 3 months old and has a fever, seek care immediately. For children older than 3 months old, seek medical care if their fever reaches 102 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.
Fever with any of the following symptoms can also be a cause for concern in children:
Non-blanching dark rashes
Extreme irritability or lethargy
Severe pain
Difficulty moving a part of the body (most importantly the neck)
Trouble breathing or quick/forceful breathing
Poor appetite or fluid intake with decreased urine output
If ever in doubt, please reach out to your primary care physician. We can help you evaluate your symptoms and guide you in the right direction so you or your child can get the care you need.

UniversityReviewed/Revised Jul 2024VIEW PROFESSIONAL VERSIONGET THE QUICK FACTSCauses|Evaluation|Treatment|Essentials for Older People|Key Points|Fever is an elevated body temperature that occurs when the body's thermostat (located in the hypothalamus in the brain) resets at a higher temperature, primarily in response to an infection. Elevated body temperature that is not caused by a resetting of the temperature set point is called hyperthermia. Although 98.6° F (37° C) is considered normal temperature, body temperature varies throughout the day. It is lowest in the early morning and highest in the late afternoonsometimes reaching 99.9° F (37.7° C). Similarly, a fever does not stay at a constant temperature. Sometimes temperature peaks every day and then returns to normal. This process is called intermittent fever. Alternatively, temperature varies but does not return to normal. This process is called remittent fever. Doctors no longer think that the pattern of the rise and fall of fever is very important in the diagnosis of certain disorders.Body temperature can be measured at several areas of the body. The most common sites are the mouth (oral temperature) and rectum (rectal temperature). Other sites include the ear, forehead, and, much less preferably, armpit. Temperature is typically measured using a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers containing mercury are not recommended because they can break and expose people to mercury.Oral temperatures are considered elevated whenThey are higher than 99° F (37° C) in the early morning.They are higher than 100.4° F (38° C) at any time after the early morning.They are higher than a persons known normal everyday temperature.Rectal and ear temperatures are about 1.0° F (0.6° C) higher than oral temperatures. Skin temperatures (for example, the forehead) are about 1.0° F (0.6° C) lower than oral temperatures. Many people use the term fever loosely, often meaning that they feel too warm, too cold, or sweaty, but they have not actually measured their temperature.The ability to generate a fever is reduced in certain people (for example, those who are very old, very young, or who have an alcohol use disorder).(See also Overview of Infectious Disease and Fever in Infants and Children.)Consequences of feverThe symptoms people have are due mainly to the condition causing the fever rather than the fever itself.Although many people worry that fever can cause harm, the typical temporary elevations in body temperature ranging from 100.4° to 104° F (38° to 40° C) caused by most short-lived (acute) infections are well-tolerated by healthy adults. As one of the body's defenses against an infection, a fever can trigger the production of antibodies and make it more difficult for microorganisms to grow, and may lessen the severity of an infection and help it go away. However, a moderate fever may be slightly dangerous for adults with a heart or lung disorder because fever causes the heart rate and breathing rate to increase. Fever can also worsen mental status in people with dementia.Additionally, an extreme temperature elevation (typically more than 105.8° F, or 41° C) may be damaging. A body temperature this high can cause malfunction and ultimately failure of most organs. Such extreme elevation sometimes results from very severe infection (such as sepsis, malaria, or meningitis) but is more typically caused by heatstroke or use of certain illicit drugs (such as
or PCP).Fever in healthy children can cause febrile seizures.Causes of Fever in AdultsSubstances that cause fever are called pyrogens. Pyrogens can come from inside or outside the body. Microorganisms and the substances they produce (such as toxins) are examples of pyrogens formed outside the body. Pyrogens formed inside the body are usually produced by 2 types of white blood cells called monocytes and macrophages. Pyrogens from outside the body can cause fever by stimulating the body to release its own pyrogens or by directly affecting the area of the brain that controls temperature.Many disorders can cause fever. They are broadly categorized asInfectious (most common)Neoplastic (cancer)Inflammatory (including autoimmune disorders, allergic reactions, and some drug reactions)An infectious cause is highly likely in adults with a fever that lasts 4 days or less (called an acute fever). An acute fever in people with cancer or a known inflammatory disorder also is most likely to have an infectious cause. In healthy people, an acute fever is unlikely to be the first sign of a chronic illness. A noninfectious cause is more likely to cause fever that lasts a long time or returns. Infectious causesInfections are the most common causes of fever. Infections can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Virtually all infections can cause fever, but, overall, the most likely infectious causes are the following:Upper and lower respiratory tract infectionsGastrointestinal infectionsUrinary tract infections (UTIs)Skin infectionsMost acute respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections are viral.Neoplastic causesMany cancers cause fever, for example, leukemia, lymphoma, and kidney cancer. Inflammatory causesInflammatory disorders that cause fever include systemic rheumatic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), and giant cell arteritis. Fever may also result from an allergic reaction.Medications and drugs sometimes cause fever. For example, beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin) and sulfa medications can trigger a fever. Certain illicit drugs (such as , amphetamines, or phencyclidine) and medications such as anesthetics and antipsychotics can cause an extremely high temperature.Risk factorsCertain factors help doctors determine what is the most likely cause of fever in a person. These factors include the following:The person's health status, age, and occupationHospitalizationUse of certain medications or illicit drugsExposure to infections (for example, through travel or contact with infected people, animals, or insects)Table Some Causes of Fever Based on Risk FactorsRisk FactorCauseNone (healthy)Upper or lower respiratory tract infectionGastrointestinal infectionUrinary tract infectionSkin infectionHospitalizationBloodstream infection related to a catheter inserted in a vein (IV catheter infection)Urinary tract infection, particularly in people with a urinary catheterPneumonia, particularly in people on a ventilatorAtelectasis (collapse of part of a lung due to an airway blockage, rather than an infection)Infection or a pocket of blood (hematoma) at the site of surgeryDeep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolismDiarrhea (due to Clostridioides difficileinduced colitis)MedicationsTransfusion reactionPressure soresTravel to areas where an infection is common (endemic areas)MalariaViral hepatitisDisorders that cause diarrheaTyphoid feverZika virus, chikungunya, Ebola virus, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, measles, and yellow feverDengue feverFungal infections such as coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, or histoplasmosisRickettsial infections (such as African tick-bite fever and Mediterranean spotted fever)Exposure to insects or animals that carry disease-causing organisms, called vectors (in the United States)Ticks: Rickettsiosis, ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, babesiosis, relapsing fever, or tularemiaMosquitoes: Encephalitis caused by arboviruses, malaria, or Zika virus infection; yellow feverWild animals: Tularemia, rabies, or hantavirus infectionFleas: PlagueDomestic animals: Brucellosis, cat-scratch disease, Q fever, or toxoplasmosisBirds: Psittacosis, bird fluReptiles: Salmonella infectionBats: Rabies or histoplasmosisA weakened immune system (immunocompromise)Viruses: Varicella-zoster virus infection or cytomegalovirus infectionBacteria: Infection due to pneumococci, meningococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Nocardia, or mycobacteriaFungi: Infection due to Candida, Aspergillus, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, microsporidia, Pneumocystis jirovecii, or fungi that cause mucormycosisParasites: Infection due to Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Cryptosporidium, or Cystoisospora belliMedications and illicit drugs that can alter body temperatureAmphetaminesPhencyclidine (PCP)Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or Ecstasy)Antipsychotic medications (can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome)Anesthetics (inhaled anesthetic gases such as halothane can cause malignant hyperthermia)ThyroxineInterferons (medications that are based on substances produced by the immune system and that help block the reproduction of viruses)Medications that can trigger fever by a hypersensitivity (allergic) reactionBeta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin)Sulfa drugsPhenytoinCarbamazepineProcainamideQuinidineEvaluation of Fever in AdultsUsually, a doctor can determine that an infection is present based on a brief history, a physical examination, and occasionally a few simple tests, such as a chest x-ray and urine tests. However, sometimes the cause of fever is not readily identified.When doctors initially evaluate people with an acute fever, they focus on 2 general issues:Identifying other symptoms such as headache or cough: These symptoms help narrow the range of possible causes.Determining whether the person is seriously or chronically ill: Many of the possible acute viral infections go away on their own and also are difficult for doctors to diagnose specifically (that is, to determine exactly which virus is causing the infection). Limiting testing to people who are seriously or chronically ill can help avoid many expensive, unnecessary, and often fruitless searches.Warning signsIn people with an acute fever, certain signs and characteristics are cause for concern. They includeA change in mental function, such as confusionA headache, stiff neck, or bothFlat, small, purplish red spots on the skin (petechiae), which indicate bleeding under the skinLow blood pressureRapid heart rate or rapid breathingShortness of breath (dyspnea)A temperature that is higher than 104° F (40° C) or lower than 95° F (35° C)Recent travel to an area where a serious infectious disease such as malaria is commonRecent use of medications that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressants)When to see a doctorPeople who have any warning signs should see a doctor right away. Such people typically need immediate testing and often admission to a hospital.People without warning signs should call the doctor if the fever lasts more than 24 to 48 hours. Depending on the person's age, other symptoms, and known medical conditions, the doctor may ask the person to come for evaluation or recommend treatment at home. Typically, people should see a doctor if a fever lasts more than 3 or 4 days regardless of other symptoms.What the doctor doesDoctors first ask questions about the person's symptoms and medical history. Doctors then do a physical examination. What they find during the history and physical examination often suggests a cause of the fever and the tests that may need to be done.A doctor begins by asking a person about present and previous symptoms and disorders, medications currently being taken, any blood transfusions, exposure to infections, recent travel, vaccinations, and recent hospitalizations, surgeries, or other medical procedures. The pattern of the fever rarely helps the doctor make a diagnosis. However, a fever that returns every other day or every third day is typical of malaria. Doctors consider malaria and other insect-transmitted infections as a possible cause only if people have traveled to an area where the infection is common.Recent travel may give the doctor clues as to the cause of a fever because some infections occur in certain areas. For example, coccidioidomycosis (a fungal infection) occurs mostly in the southwestern United States.Recent exposures are also important. For example, people who work in a meatpacking plant are more likely to develop brucellosis (a bacterial infection spread through contact with domestic animals). Other examples include unsafe water or food (such as unpasteurized milk and milk products, and raw or undercooked meat, fish, and shellfish), insect (such as mosquitoes) and tick bites, unprotected sex, and occupational or recreational exposures (such as hunting, hiking, and water sports).Pain is an important clue to the possible source of fever, so the doctor asks about any pain in the ears, head, neck, teeth, throat, chest, abdomen, flank, rectum, muscles, and joints.Other symptoms that help determine the cause of the fever include nasal congestion and/or discharge, cough, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency, and pain while urinating). Knowing whether the person has enlarged lymph nodes or a rash (including what it looks like, where it is, and when it appeared in relation to other symptoms) may help the doctor pinpoint a cause. People with recurring fevers, night sweats, and weight loss may have a chronic infection such as tuberculosis or endocarditis (infection of the heart's lining and usually the heart valves).The doctor may also ask about the following:Contact with anyone who has an infectionAny known conditions that predispose to infection, such as HIV infection, diabetes, cancer, organ transplantation, sickle cell disease, use of an artificial pacemaker, or heart valve disorders, particularly if an artificial valve is presentAny known disorders that may cause a fever without infection, such as lupus, gout, sarcoidosis, an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism), or cancerUse of any medications that may make a person susceptible to infection, such as cancer chemotherapy, corticosteroids, or other medications that suppress the immune systemUse of illicit drugs that are injectedThe physical examination begins with confirmation of fever. Fever is most accurately determined by measuring rectal temperature, but oral or ear temperature is often measured. Forehead temperature is not as accurate as rectal, but doctors may measure forehead temperature to screen people for fever. Armpit temperature is the least accurate, so doctors rarely use it to confirm a fever. Doctors then do a thorough examination from head to toe to check for a source of infection or evidence of disease.TestingThe need for testing depends on what the doctor finds during the medical history and physical examination.Otherwise healthy people who have an acute fever and only vague, general symptoms (for example, they feel generally ill or achy) probably have a viral illness that will go away without treatment. Therefore, they do not usually require testing. Exceptions are people who are in an area where COVID-19 is being spread, people who have been exposed to an animal or insect that carries and transmits a specific disease (called a vector), such as people with a tick bite, and people who have recently been in an area where a particular disorder (such as malaria) is common.If otherwise healthy people have findings that suggest a particular disorder, testing may be needed. Doctors select tests based on those findings. For example, if people have a headache and stiff neck, a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) is done to look for meningitis. If people have a cough and lung congestion, a chest x-ray is done to look for pneumonia. For certain respiratory diseases, such as COVID-19 or influenza, there are rapid molecular tests that can give results within minutes or a few hours. Some rapid tests can be done at home or in a doctor's office on a sample obtained with a cotton swab. Other rapid tests to identify a specific cause of an infection require a blood sample sent to a laboratory.People who are at increased risk of infection, people who appear seriously ill, and older adults often need testing even when findings do not suggest a particular disorder. For such people, doctors may do the following:A complete blood count (including the number and proportion of different types of white blood cells)Urine and blood culturesA chest x-rayUrinalysisLab TestComplete Blood CountLab TestUrinalysisAn increase in the white blood cell count usually indicates infection. The proportion of different types of white blood cells (differential count) gives further clues. For example, an increase in neutrophils suggests a relatively new bacterial infection. An increase in eosinophils suggests the presence of parasites, such as tapeworms or roundworms. Also, blood, urine, and other body fluids may be sent to the laboratory to try to grow the microorganism in a culture. Other blood tests can be used to detect antibodies against specific microorganisms.Fever of unknown origin (FUO)A fever of unknown origin may be diagnosed when People have a fever of at least 101° F (38.3° C) for several weeks.Extensive investigation does not detect a cause.In such cases, the cause may be an unusual chronic infection (such as tuberculosis, bacterial infection of the heart, HIV infection, cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus) or something other than an infection, such as a systemic rheumatic disorder (such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis) or cancer (such as lymphoma, ovarian cancer, or leukemia). Other causes include medication or illicit drug reactions, blood clots (deep vein thrombosis), inflammation of organ tissues (sarcoidosis), and inflammatory bowel disease.In older adults, the most common causes of FUO are giant cell arteritis, lymphomas, abscesses, and tuberculosis.Doctors usually do blood tests, including a complete blood count, blood cultures, liver blood tests, and tests to check for systemic rheumatic disorders. Other tests, such as chest x-ray, urinalysis, and urine culture, may be done.Lab TestBacteria Culture TestUltrasound studies, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly of areas that are causing discomfort, may help a doctor diagnose the cause. Radionuclide scanning, done after white blood cells labeled with a radioactive marker are injected into a vein, or positron emission tomography (PET) may be used to identify areas of infection or inflammation.If these test results are negative, doctors may need to take a sample of tissue from the liver, bone marrow, or another site of suspected infection for biopsy. The sample is then examined under a microscope, cultured, and analyzed.The treatment of FUO is focused on treating the disorder causing the fever if it is known. Doctors may give medications to lower the body temperature (see treatment of fever).Treatment of Fever in AdultsThe best fever treatment is treatment of the cause.Because fever helps the body defend against infection and because fever itself is not dangerous (unless it is higher than about 106° F [41° C]), there is some debate as to whether fever should be routinely treated. However, people with a high fever generally feel much better when the fever is treated. Plus, people with a heart or lung disorder and those with dementia are considered to be at particular risk of dangerous complications, so when they have a fever, it should be treated.Medications used to lower body temperature are called antipyretics.Because many over-the-counter cold or flu preparations contain acetaminophen, people must be careful not to take acetaminophen and one or more of these cold or flu preparations at the same time.Other cooling measures (such as cooling with a tepid water mist and using cooling blankets) are needed only if the temperature is about 106° F (41.1° C) or higher. People should not apply rubbing alcohol to their skin with a washcloth or sponge because alcohol can be absorbed through the skin and may have harmful effects.People who have a blood infection (bacteremia) or who have abnormal vital signs (such as low blood pressure and a rapid pulse and breathing rate) are admitted to the hospital.Essentials for Older People: FeverFever can be tricky in older people because the body may not respond the way it would in younger people. For example, in frail older adults, infection is less likely to cause fever. Even when elevated by infection, the temperature may be lower than the standard definition of fever, and the degree of fever may not correspond to the severity of the illness. Similarly, other symptoms, such as pain, may be less noticeable. Frequently, a change in mental function or a decline in daily functioning is the only other initial sign of pneumonia or a urinary tract infection.However, older adults with a fever are more likely to have a serious bacterial infection than are younger adults with a fever. As in younger adults, the cause is commonly a respiratory or urinary tract infection. Skin and soft-tissue infections are also common causes of fever in older adults. Older adults are more likely to have serious manifestations of respiratory viral infections such as influenza, COVID-19, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Diagnosis of fever in older adults is similar to that for younger adults, except that for older adults, doctors usually recommend urine tests (including culture) and a chest x-ray. Samples of blood are cultured to rule out a blood infection (bacteremia).Key PointsMost fevers in healthy people are caused by a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection due to a virus.If people with a fever have any warning signs, they should see a doctor right away.Doctors can usually identify an infection based on a brief medical history, a physical examination, and occasionally a few simple tests, and then doctors use these results, particularly symptoms, to determine which other tests are needed.Doctors consider underlying chronic disorders, particularly those that impair the immune system, as a possible cause of fever that lasts a long time.In older adults, infections are less likely to cause fever, and other symptoms may be less noticeable.Test your KnowledgeTake a Quiz!

It's one part of an overall response from the body's immune system. A fever is usually caused by an infection.For most children and adults, a fever may be uncomfortable. But it usually isn't a cause for concern. For infants, however, even a low fever may mean there's a serious infection.Fevers generally go away within a few days. A number of over-the-counter medications lower a fever. But you don't necessarily need to treat a fever if it's not causing discomfort.Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Home RemediesSymptomsBody temperatures vary slightly from person to person and at different times of day. The average temperature has traditionally been defined as 98.6 F (37 C). A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever.Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include:
Sweating
Chills and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Irritability
Dehydration
General weakness
Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers.Oral and rectal thermometers generally provide the most accurate measurement of core body temperature. Ear or forehead thermometers, although convenient, provide less accurate temperature measurements.In infants, a rectal temperature, if doable, is somewhat more accurate. When reporting a temperature to your health care provider, give both the reading and the type of thermometer used.When to see a doctorFevers by themselves may not be a cause for alarm  or a reason to call a doctor. Yet there are some circumstances when you should seek medical advice for your baby, your child or yourself.Infants and toddlersA fever is a particular cause for concern in infants and toddlers. Call your baby's health care provider if your child is:
Younger than 3 months old and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
Between 3 and 6 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) or has a lower temperature but seems unusually irritable, sluggish or uncomfortable.
Between 7 and 24 months old and has a rectal temperature higher than 102 F (38.9 C) that lasts longer than one day but shows no other symptoms. If your child also has other signs and symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough or diarrhea, you can call sooner.
ChildrenThere's probably no cause for alarm if your child has a fever but is responsive. This means your child makes eye contact with you and responds to your facial expressions and to your voice. Your child may also be drinking fluids and playing.Call your child's health care provider if your child:
Is listless, confused or has poor eye contact with you.
Is irritable, vomits repeatedly, has a severe headache, sore throat, stomachache or other symptoms causing a lot of discomfort.
Has a fever after being left in a hot car. Seek medical care immediately.
Has a fever that lasts longer than three days.
Has a seizure associated with the fever. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't recover quickly.
Ask your child's health care provider for guidance in special circumstances, such as a child with immune system problems or with a preexisting illness.AdultsCall your health care provider if your temperature is 103 F (39.4 C) or higher. Seek immediate medical attention if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:
Severe headache
Rash
Unusual sensitivity to bright light
Stiff neck and pain when you bend your head forward
Mental confusion, strange behavior or altered speech
Persistent vomiting
Difficulty breathing or chest pain
Abdominal pain
Pain when urinating
Convulsions or seizures

An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs)  also known as your body's "thermostat"  monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful.Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by:
A viral infection
A bacterial infection
Heat exhaustion
Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis  inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium)
A cancerous (malignant) tumor
Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures
Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine
ComplicationsChildren between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are at increased risk of a seizure that occurs during a fever (febrile seizure). About a third of the children who have one febrile seizure will have another one, most commonly within the next 12 months.A febrile seizure may involve loss of consciousness, shaking of limbs on both sides of the body, eyes rolling back or body stiffness. Although alarming for parents, the vast majority of febrile seizures cause no lasting effects.If a seizure occurs:
Lay your child on the side or stomach on the floor or ground
Remove any sharp objects that are near your child
Loosen tight clothing
Hold your child to prevent injury
Don't place anything in your child's mouth or try to stop the seizure
Call 911 or your local emergency number if a seizure lasts more than five minutes or your child doesn't appear to recover well after the seizure
Get emergency room or urgent care services if it's your child's first febrile seizure.
If your child doesn't need emergency care, see your child's health care provider as soon as possible for further evaluation.PreventionYou may be able to prevent fevers by reducing exposure to infectious diseases. Here are some tips that can help:
Get vaccinated as recommended for infectious diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19.
Follow public health guidelines for wearing masks and social distancing.
Wash your hands often and teach your children to do the same, especially before eating, after using the toilet, after spending time in a crowd or around someone who's sick, after petting animals, and during travel on public transportation.
Show your children how to wash their hands thoroughly, covering both the front and back of each hand with soap and rinsing completely under running water.
Carry hand sanitizer with you for times when you don't have access to soap and water.
Try to avoid touching your nose, mouth or eyes, as these are the main ways that viruses and bacteria can enter your body and cause infection.
Cover your mouth when you cough and your nose when you sneeze, and teach your children to do the same. Whenever possible, turn away from others and cough or sneeze into your elbow to avoid passing germs along to them.
Avoid sharing cups, water bottles and utensils with your child or children.

Most providers say a fever is either 100.0 F (37.8 C) or 100.4 F (38 C). When you have a fever, its your bodys normal response to fighting an infection or illness. Fevers usually arent a serious concern. They typically go away when the infection passes.ContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsContentsArrow DownOverviewPossible CausesCare and TreatmentWhen To Call the DoctorAdditional Common QuestionsOverviewWhat is a fever?A fever is when your body temperature rises higher than normal. A fever itself isnt an illness. Rather, its a symptom of a wide range of health conditions. When your body temperature rises a few degrees above normal, it can be a sign that your immune system has been activated, often to fight an infection. It can also be a side effect of some medications and vaccinations.What is considered a fever?Common knowledge states that a normal body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). But your baseline body temperature may vary by a degree or more. It also fluctuates. Its typically lower in the morning and higher in the evening. Its higher during certain points of your menstrual cycle and when youre exercising.Infants and young children normally have slightly higher body temperatures than older children and adults. So infants and younger children have slightly higher fever temperatures.There are no strict guidelines for what temperature is a fever, because body temperature varies by person, time of day and method of measurement. But healthcare providers most often say a fever temperature is 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) when measured orally (by mouth).Rectal and ear thermometers typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) higher than oral thermometers. Skin thermometers (such as forehead thermometers) typically measure temperatures at about 1.0 degrees F (0.6 degrees C) lower than oral thermometers.What is a low-grade fever?A low-grade fever means a body temperature slightly above normal. This type of fever can be a sign your immune system has been mildly activated. Theres no standard low-grade fever range. But many healthcare providers consider a body temperature between 99.5 degrees F (37.5 degrees C) and 100.3 degrees F (38.3 degrees C) to be a low-grade fever.AdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. PolicyWhat are fever symptoms?In addition to an elevated temperature, you may experience the following symptoms:Chills, feeling cold, shivering and shaking.Body aches and headaches.Fatigue (tiredness).On and off or constant sweating.Flushed complexion or hot skin.Faster heart beats.Additional fever symptoms in babies and children may include:Lack of appetite  not eating and drinking well.Earache or pulling at their ears.High-pitched crying.Fussiness.Paleness or flushness.Excessive thirst.Decreased urination.Possible CausesWhat are the most common causes of fever?A fever has many causes and can be a symptom of almost any illness. Common conditions that cause fever include:Bacterial infections.Viral infections such as influenza or COVID-19.Gastrointestinal (GI) infections.Urinary tract infections.Skin infections.You may also develop a fever due to:A reaction to certain medications.Vaccinations.Autoimmune disorders.Cancer.Can allergies cause fever?Allergies can cause cold-like symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes, but they typically dont cause fever. Despite its name, hay fever (also called allergic rhinitis) doesnt cause fever.AdvertisementCare and TreatmentWhats the best way to measure body temperature?You can take your temperature in several different parts of your body. The most common site is your mouth (oral temperature). Other sites include your ear (tympanic membrane), forehead (temporal artery) and armpit (axillary). The most accurate site is the rectum, and the least accurate site is the armpit.The best way to measure your temperature is with a digital thermometer. Glass thermometers contain mercury and providers no longer recommend them.How can I break a fever at home?If your fever is mild  less than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C)  you usually dont need treatment with medication. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and get plenty of rest. Taking a lukewarm bath  about 98 degrees F (36.7 degrees C)  may also help bring your bodys temperature down. Keep an eye on signs of dehydration and other worsening symptoms.If youre feeling uncomfortable and your temperature is higher than 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C), you can try to break the fever. The most common way to get rid of a fever is to use over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.Dont give aspirin to children under the age of 17. Aspirin in children may cause Reyes syndrome, a sometimes fatal illness.Does ibuprofen reduce fever?Yes, you can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen to try to reduce a fever.How long does a fever last?The cause of the fever determines how long itll last. Typically, if an infection is the cause of your fever, it should pass within three to four days. Call your healthcare provider if the fever lingers longer than that or comes along with breathing changes.AdvertisementCan fevers be prevented?You can prevent some fevers by avoiding the illnesses and infections that cause them. Sometimes, children develop fevers after receiving vaccinations. You can prevent these types of fevers by giving your child acetaminophen just before or after the vaccination. But you cant prevent most fevers. Theyre typically a sign that your body is doing what its supposed to do.Care at Cleveland ClinicFind a Primary Care ProviderSchedule an AppointmentWhen To Call the DoctorWhen should a fever be treated by a healthcare provider?In adults, fevers less than 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) typically arent dangerous and arent a cause for concern. If your fever rises above that level, make a call to your healthcare provider for treatment.In children, call your childs healthcare provider if:Their fever lasts more than five days.Their fever is higher than 104 degrees F (40 degrees C).Medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen dont break the fever.Youre concerned they arent behaving normally.They have any problems breathing or urinating.When should I go to the ER?If you have a fever along with any of the following symptoms, go to your nearest emergency room or call 911. It may be a sign of a serious or life-threatening illness.Pain or tenderness in your belly (abdomen).Nausea or vomiting.Severe headache.Stiff neck.Light irritates your eyes (photophobia).Convulsions or seizures.Difficulty breathing.Strange behavior and/or altered speech.Confusion or irritability.Difficulty waking or extreme sleepiness.Fever rash (small bleeding spots under your skin).When should I take my child to the ER?If your baby has a fever and is under 3 months of age, take them to the ER right away. Your babys immune system hasnt developed fully yet, and they could have a serious infection.If your child has a fever along with any of the following symptoms, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room:Extreme sluggishness or drowsiness.Lack of appetite.Excessive drooling or difficulty swallowing.Continuous crying.Stiff neck.Fever rash.Difficulty breathing.Severe abdominal pain.Redness or swelling.Dehydration (not drinking many fluids).Decreased urination.What are the possible complications or risks of not treating a fever?Untreated fevers above 105.8 degrees F (41 degrees C) can be dangerous. If your body temperature reaches this level, your organs will begin to malfunction and will eventually fail.Even moderate fevers can be dangerous for adults with lung or heart disorders because fever causes your breathing rate and heart rate to increase. Fever can also worsen the mental state of people with dementia.Additional Common QuestionsWhat is a recurrent fever?A recurrent fever is a fever that keeps coming back multiple times over a period of time. Providers call these fevers episodic because they come and go. The fever lasts for a few days and then goes away for a stretch of time. Your child is healthy and acts normally between fevers. Recurrent fevers affect young children under the age of 5 most often. Theyre one of the main symptoms of a collection of conditions called periodic fever syndromes.What is a febrile seizure?Some children have a side effect of fevers called febrile seizures. This happens in 2% to 4% of children under the age of 5. Some seizures cause jerking movements, or it may look like your child has passed out. When this happens, put your child on their side and dont put anything in their mouth. Call 911 if the seizure lasts for more than five minutes and/or your childs lips turn blue.If the seizure lasts less than five minutes, notify their healthcare provider and get medical attention right away.What is a fever dream?Fever dreams are vivid, bizarre or unpleasant dreams you may experience when your body temperature rises higher than normal. Researchers dont know the exact cause of fever dreams. But some scientists think fevers cause your brain to overheat, affecting your cognitive processing, which results in dreams stranger than your typical dreams. Fevers may also interrupt your REM sleep cycle, which can lead to unusual dreams.A note from Cleveland ClinicWhile a fever can be uncomfortable, its typically a sign that your body is working properly and your immune system is kicking into action. You dont need to treat low fevers, but you can take over-the-counter pain relievers until they pass. If you or your child has a higher temperature or your fever hasnt passed within a few days, you should make a call to your healthcare provider. While infections most often cause fevers, there could be other underlying conditions youll want to get checked out.Medically ReviewedLast reviewed on 05/31/2023.Learn more about our editorial process.ReferencesAdvertisementCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

It is a common sign of an infection.As a persons body temperature increases, they may feel cold until it levels off and stops rising. People describe this as chills.Eating, exercise, sleeping, the time of day, and individual factors can also affect temperature. When an infection occurs, the immune system will launch an attack to try to remove the cause. A high body temperature is a normal part of this reaction. A fever will usually resolve on its own. However, if body temperature rises too high, it may be a symptom of a severe infection that needs medical treatment. In this case, a doctor may recommend medication to reduce it.Read on to learn more about the symptoms of a fever, as well as some causes and treatment options.SymptomsShare on PinterestA fever is a common sign of an infection.When someone has a fever, they may also:shiver and feel cold when nobody else doessweathave a low appetiteshow signs of dehydrationhave increased sensitivity to painlack energy and feel sleepyhave difficulty concentratingIf a baby has a fever, they may:feel hot to the touchhave flushed cheeksbe sweaty or clammyWith a high fever, there may also be irritability, confusion, delirium, and seizures.COVID-19 symptomsIf a person has a fever with a dry cough, they may have symptoms of COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urge people with these symptoms to stay at home and away from other people. The person should also wear a face covering if other people are near.In many cases, the symptoms will improve without specialist treatment. However, if the person also develops severe chest pain or difficulty breathing, they should call 911 and ask for medical help. Taking a temperatureTo take a temperature, most people now use a digital thermometer. Experts do not recommend using a glass thermometer, as these can be dangerous. Some people use a forehead strip, but these may be less accurate.A person can put a thermometer under their arm or in their mouth.To use a digital device: Clean the tip using cold water and soap, and then rinse it.Turn on the device.Place the tip under the tongue, toward the back of the mouth, and close the mouth. Or, place it under the armpit and hold the device close to the body.Wait until there is a flash or the thermometer beeps.Read the temperature.Normal armpit temperature will be around 0.5 to 0.9ºF (0.3 to 0.5°C) lower than oral temperature.If the reading is 100.4°F (38°C) or above, the person has a fever. Thermometers are available for purchase over the counter or online.Is it possible to take someones temperature without a thermometer? Find out here.When should I worry?Doctors classify fevers according to how long they last, whether or not they come and go, and how high they are.SeverityCore body temperature varies from person to person.Most experts consider a temperature of 100.4° F (38°C) to be a fever, but in children, this may be lower, at 99.5°F (37.5°C).Hyperpyrexia can occur when a persons temperature rises above 106°F (41.1°C). Without treatment, this can lead to complications.Learn more about normal body temperature and when a person should worry here.DurationA fever can be:acute if it lasts for under 7 dayssubacute if it lasts for up to 14 dayschronic or persistent if it lasts for over 14 daysFevers that exist for days or weeks with no explanation are called fevers of unknown origin.TreatmentA mild fever is part of the immune systems response to bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. It helps the body fight off infection.However, it can be uncomfortable, and a high fever can sometimes lead to complications. For this reason, doctors may sometimes recommend medications called antipyretics to lower a persons temperature.Examples include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can also reduce a fever. Aspirin can help, but it is not suitable for children, and it may not be suitable for people who take blood thinners. NSAIDs and Tylenol are available to purchase over the counter or online.If a person is sweating a lot, they may experience dehydration. In this case, they should consume plenty of fluids to prevent complications.Treating the causeA fever is a symptom, not an illness. A doctor may wish to carry out tests to identify the cause. If the fever is due to a bacterial infection, they may prescribe an antibiotic.If it stems from a viral infection, the doctor may recommend using NSAIDs to relieve the symptoms. Antibiotics will not stop a virus. A doctor will not prescribe them for a viral infection.NSAIDs will not help if the fever is due to hot weather or sustained strenuous exercise. In these cases, it is essential to cool the person down. If they are confused or unconscious, they need immediate medical care.COVID-19A person with symptoms of COVID-19 may not need any medical treatment. However, if they develop severe chest pains and have difficulty breathing, they may need hospital treatment. Some people will need to spend time on a ventilator, which is a device that will help them breathe.CausesFevers can result from various factors, including:an infection, such as strep throat, the flu, chickenpox, pneumonia, or COVID-19rheumatoid arthritissome medicationsoverexposing the skin to sunlight, or sunburnheatstroke, either due to high ambient temperatures or prolonged strenuous exercisedehydrationsilicosis, which is a type of lung disease caused by long-term exposure to silica dustamphetamine abusealcohol withdrawalIn childrenChildren with a high temperature may develop a febrile seizure. These are most likely to occur between the ages of 12 and 18 months.These often result from an ear infection, gastroenteritis, or a respiratory virus, and they are not usually serious. Less commonly, they may stem from a more severe illness, such as meningitis, a kidney infection, or pneumonia.Seizures can occur when the body temperature rises quickly.There are two types of febrile seizure: simple febrile seizures and complex febrile seizures.Simple febrile seizuresThis type of febrile seizure can last from a few seconds up to 15 minutes. However, it usually lasts less than 5 minutes. It does not occur again during a 24-hour period. Around 8085% of febrile seizures are of this type.It typically involves the whole body, and symptoms include:stiffness in the bodytwitching in the arms and legsa loss of consciousness while the eyes stay openThere may also be: irregular breathingurination, defecation, or bothvomitingComplex febrile seizuresThis type of febrile seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes, comes back more often, and tends to affect only a part of the body, rather than the whole body.Complex febrile seizures are more serious than simple febrile seizures. A child who has a complex febrile seizure is more likely to experience epilepsy as they grow older.In fact, around 3040% of children who have either type of seizure will have other similar seizures at a later date.When to see a doctorIn most cases, a child who has a seizure should see a doctor. The doctor may suggest controlling their temperature with acetaminophen and ensuring that they drink plenty of fluids. If necessary, they may also prescribe an anticonvulsant, such as sodium valproate or clonazepam.DiagnosisA fever is a symptom, not an illness. A doctor can diagnose a fever by checking the persons body temperature, but they will also need to diagnose the reason for the fever.To do so, they will examine the individual and ask them about any other symptoms and their medical history. If the person has recently experienced another infection, if they have recently had surgery, or if there is pain or swelling in one area, it may indicate what kind of infection is likely to be present.To confirm a diagnosis, the doctor may recommend: a blood testa urine testimaging testsThe treatment they prescribe will depend on the cause of the fever.PreventionTo prevent a fever, people should follow the usual steps for reducing the risk of an infection.These include regular hand-washing and staying away from people who are unwell.Preventing COVID-19To reduce the risk of transmitting or contracting COVID-19, the CDC recommend: washing the hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds each timeusing hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not availablenot touching the face with unwashed handscovering the face with a mask or cloth covering when near other people, except for children under 2 yearscleaning and disinfecting surfaces regularlycoughing and sneezing into a tissue, then disposing of the tissue and washing the handsavoiding close contact with people who are unwellFor information on how to make and wear a face mask, see the CDCs advice here.SummaryA fever is usually a symptom of an infection. It is not usually a cause for concern, but the underlying illness may need medical treatment. Often, a fever will resolve without medical attention. However, if a child or an older adult has a fever, if the individual has other severe or worsening symptoms, or if they have a weakened immune system, they should seek medical help.If a person has a dry cough with a fever, they may have COVID-19. If they start to experience difficulty breathing, someone should call 911 and ask for emergency help.
